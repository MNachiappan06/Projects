His courtiers had all\\ntaken their leave of him, bowing their heads to the ground, according to\\nthe ceremonious usage of the day, and had retired to the Great Hall of\\nthe Palace, to receive a few last lessons from the Professor of\\nEtiquette; there being some of them who had still quite natural manners,\\nwhich in a courtier is, I need hardly say, a very grave offence.\\n\\nThe lad—for he was only a lad, being but sixteen years of age—was not\\nsorry at their departure, and had flung himself back with a deep sigh of\\nrelief on the soft cushions of his embroidered couch, lying there,\\nwild-eyed and open-mouthed, like a brown woodland Faun, or some young\\nanimal of the forest newly snared by the hunters.\\n\\nAnd, indeed, it was the hunters who had found him, coming upon him almost\\nby chance as, bare-limbed and pipe in hand, he was following the flock of\\nthe poor goatherd who had brought him up, and whose son he had always\\nfancied himself to be.  The child of the old King’s only daughter by a\\nsecret marriage with one much beneath her in station—a stranger, some\\nsaid, who, by the wonderful magic of his lute-playing, had made the young\\nPrincess love him; while others spoke of an artist from Rimini, to whom\\nthe Princess had shown much, perhaps too much honour, and who had\\nsuddenly disappeared from the city, leaving his work in the Cathedral\\nunfinished—he had been, when but a week old, stolen away from his\\nmother’s side, as she slept, and given into the charge of a common\\npeasant and his wife, who were without children of their own, and lived\\nin a remote part of the forest, more than a day’s ride from the town.\\nGrief, or the plague, as the court physician stated, or, as some\\nsuggested, a swift Italian poison administered in a cup of spiced wine,\\nslew, within an hour of her wakening, the white girl who had given him\\nbirth, and as the trusty messenger who bare the child across his\\nsaddle-bow stooped from his weary horse and knocked at the rude door of\\nthe goatherd’s hut, the body of the Princess was being lowered into an\\nopen grave that had been dug in a deserted churchyard, beyond the city\\ngates, a grave where it was said that another body was also lying, that\\nof a young man of marvellous and foreign beauty, whose hands were tied\\nbehind him with a knotted cord, and whose breast was stabbed with many\\nred wounds.\\n\\nSuch, at least, was the story that men whispered to each other.  Certain\\nit was that the old King, when on his deathbed, whether moved by remorse\\nfor his great sin, or merely desiring that the kingdom should not pass\\naway from his line, had had the lad sent for, and, in the presence of the\\nCouncil, had acknowledged him as his heir.\\n\\nAnd it seems that from the very first moment of his recognition he had\\nshown signs of that strange passion for beauty that was destined to have\\nso great an influence over his life.  Those who accompanied him to the\\nsuite of rooms set apart for his service, often spoke of the cry of\\npleasure that broke from his lips when he saw the delicate raiment and\\nrich jewels that had been prepared for him, and of the almost fierce joy\\nwith which he flung aside his rough leathern tunic and coarse sheepskin\\ncloak.  He missed, indeed, at times the fine freedom of his forest life,\\nand was always apt to chafe at the tedious Court ceremonies that occupied\\nso much of each day, but the wonderful palace—_Joyeuse_, as they called\\nit—of which he now found himself lord, seemed to him to be a new world\\nfresh-fashioned for his delight; and as soon as he could escape from the\\ncouncil-board or audience-chamber, he would run down the great staircase,\\nwith its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry, and\\nwander from room to room, and from corridor to corridor, like one who was\\nseeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain, a sort of restoration\\nfrom sickness.\\n\\nUpon these journeys of discovery, as he would call them—and, indeed, they\\nwere to him real voyages through a marvellous land, he would sometimes be\\naccompanied by the slim, fair-haired Court pages, with their floating\\nmantles, and gay fluttering ribands; but more often he would be alone,\\nfeeling through a certain quick instinct, which was almost a divination,\\nthat the secrets of art are best learned in secret, and that Beauty, like\\nWisdom, loves the lonely worshipper.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nMany curious stories were related about him at this period.  It was said\\nthat a stout Burgo-master, who had come to deliver a florid oratorical\\naddress on behalf of the citizens of the town, had caught sight of him\\nkneeling in real adoration before a great picture that had just been\\nbrought from Venice, and that seemed to herald the worship of some new\\ngods.  On another occasion he had been missed for several hours, and\\nafter a lengthened search had been discovered in a little chamber in one\\nof the northern turrets of the palace gazing, as one in a trance, at a\\nGreek gem carved with the figure of Adonis.  He had been seen, so the\\ntale ran, pressing his warm lips to the marble brow of an antique statue\\nthat had been discovered in the bed of the river on the occasion of the\\nbuilding of the stone bridge, and was inscribed with the name of the\\nBithynian slave of Hadrian.  He had passed a whole night in noting the\\neffect of the moonlight on a silver image of Endymion.\\n\\nAll rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him,\\nand in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants,\\nsome to traffic for amber with the rough fisher-folk of the north seas,\\nsome to Egypt to look for that curious green turquoise which is found\\nonly in the tombs of kings, and is said to possess magical properties,\\nsome to Persia for silken carpets and painted pottery, and others to\\nIndia to buy gauze and stained ivory, moonstones and bracelets of jade,\\nsandal-wood and blue enamel and shawls of fine wool.\\n\\nBut what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his\\ncoronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby-studded crown, and the\\nsceptre with its rows and rings of pearls.  Indeed, it was of this that\\nhe was thinking to-night, as he lay back on his luxurious couch, watching\\nthe great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth.\\nThe designs, which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the\\ntime, had been submitted to him many months before, and he had given\\norders that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out,\\nand that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would be\\nworthy of their work.  He saw himself in fancy standing at the high altar\\nof the cathedral in the fair raiment of a King, and a smile played and\\nlingered about his boyish lips, and lit up with a bright lustre his dark\\nwoodland eyes.\\n\\nAfter some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved\\npenthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly-lit room.  The walls\\nwere hung with rich tapestries representing the Triumph of Beauty.  A\\nlarge press, inlaid with agate and lapis-lazuli, filled one corner, and\\nfacing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels\\nof powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets\\nof Venetian glass, and a cup of dark-veined onyx.  Pale poppies were\\nbroidered on the silk coverlet of the bed, as though they had fallen from\\nthe tired hands of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the\\nvelvet canopy, from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang, like\\nwhite foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling.  A laughing\\nNarcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head.  On the\\ntable stood a flat bowl of amethyst.\\n\\nOutside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming like a\\nbubble over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels pacing up and\\ndown on the misty terrace by the river.  Far away, in an orchard, a\\nnightingale was singing.  A faint perfume of jasmine came through the\\nopen window.  He brushed his brown curls back from his forehead, and\\ntaking up a lute, let his fingers stray across the cords.  His heavy\\neyelids drooped, and a strange languor came over him.  Never before had\\nhe felt so keenly, or with such exquisite joy, the magic and the mystery\\nof beautiful things.\\n\\nWhen midnight sounded from the clock-tower he touched a bell, and his\\npages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony, pouring rose-water\\nover his hands, and strewing flowers on his pillow.  A few moments after\\nthat they had left the room, he fell asleep.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd as he slept he dreamed a dream, and this was his dream.\\n\\nHe thought that he was standing in a long, low attic, amidst the whir and\\nclatter of many looms.  The meagre daylight peered in through the grated\\nwindows, and showed him the gaunt figures of the weavers bending over\\ntheir cases.  Pale, sickly-looking children were crouched on the huge\\ncrossbeams.  As the shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the\\nheavy battens, and when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall\\nand pressed the threads together.  Their faces were pinched with famine,\\nand their thin hands shook and trembled.  Some haggard women were seated\\nat a table sewing.  A horrible odour filled the place.  The air was foul\\nand heavy, and the walls dripped and streamed with damp.\\n\\nThe young King went over to one of the weavers, and stood by him and\\nwatched him.\\n\\nAnd the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, ‘Why art thou watching\\nme?  Art thou a spy set on us by our master?’\\n\\n‘Who is thy master?’ asked the young King.\\n\\n‘Our master!’ cried the weaver, bitterly.  ‘He is a man like myself.\\nIndeed, there is but this difference between us—that he wears fine\\nclothes while I go in rags, and that while I am weak from hunger he\\nsuffers not a little from overfeeding.’\\n\\n‘The land is free,’ said the young King, ‘and thou art no man’s slave.’\\n\\n‘In war,’ answered the weaver, ‘the strong make slaves of the weak, and\\nin peace the rich make slaves of the poor.  We must work to live, and\\nthey give us such mean wages that we die.  We toil for them all day long,\\nand they heap up gold in their coffers, and our children fade away before\\ntheir time, and the faces of those we love become hard and evil.  We\\ntread out the grapes, and another drinks the wine.  We sow the corn, and\\nour own board is empty.  We have chains, though no eye beholds them; and\\nare slaves, though men call us free.’\\n\\n‘Is it so with all?’ he asked,\\n\\n‘It is so with all,’ answered the weaver, ‘with the young as well as with\\nthe old, with the women as well as with the men, with the little children\\nas well as with those who are stricken in years.  The merchants grind us\\ndown, and we must needs do their bidding.  The priest rides by and tells\\nhis beads, and no man has care of us.  Through our sunless lanes creeps\\nPoverty with her hungry eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows close\\nbehind her.  Misery wakes us in the morning, and Shame sits with us at\\nnight.  But what are these things to thee?  Thou art not one of us.  Thy\\nface is too happy.’  And he turned away scowling, and threw the shuttle\\nacross the loom, and the young King saw that it was threaded with a\\nthread of gold.\\n\\nAnd a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, ‘What robe\\nis this that thou art weaving?’\\n\\n‘It is the robe for the coronation of the young King,’ he answered; ‘what\\nis that to thee?’\\n\\nAnd the young King gave a loud cry and woke, and lo! he was in his own\\nchamber, and through the window he saw the great honey-coloured moon\\nhanging in the dusky air.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd he fell asleep again and dreamed, and this was his dream.\\n\\nHe thought that he was lying on the deck of a huge galley that was being\\nrowed by a hundred slaves.  On a carpet by his side the master of the\\ngalley was seated.  He was black as ebony, and his turban was of crimson\\nsilk.  Great earrings of silver dragged down the thick lobes of his ears,\\nand in his hands he had a pair of ivory scales.\\n\\nThe slaves were naked, but for a ragged loin-cloth, and each man was\\nchained to his neighbour.  The hot sun beat brightly upon them, and the\\nnegroes ran up and down the gangway and lashed them with whips of hide.\\nThey stretched out their lean arms and pulled the heavy oars through the\\nwater.  The salt spray flew from the blades.\\n\\nAt last they reached a little bay, and began to take soundings.  A light\\nwind blew from the shore, and covered the deck and the great lateen sail\\nwith a fine red dust.  Three Arabs mounted on wild asses rode out and\\nthrew spears at them.  The master of the galley took a painted bow in his\\nhand and shot one of them in the throat.  He fell heavily into the surf,\\nand his companions galloped away.  A woman wrapped in a yellow veil\\nfollowed slowly on a camel, looking back now and then at the dead body.\\n\\nAs soon as they had cast anchor and hauled down the sail, the negroes\\nwent into the hold and brought up a long rope-ladder, heavily weighted\\nwith lead.  The master of the galley threw it over the side, making the\\nends fast to two iron stanchions.  Then the negroes seized the youngest\\nof the slaves and knocked his gyves off, and filled his nostrils and his\\nears with wax, and tied a big stone round his waist.  He crept wearily\\ndown the ladder, and disappeared into the sea.  A few bubbles rose where\\nhe sank.  Some of the other slaves peered curiously over the side.  At\\nthe prow of the galley sat a shark-charmer, beating monotonously upon a\\ndrum.\\n\\nAfter some time the diver rose up out of the water, and clung panting to\\nthe ladder with a pearl in his right hand.  The negroes seized it from\\nhim, and thrust him back.  The slaves fell asleep over their oars.\\n\\nAgain and again he came up, and each time that he did so he brought with\\nhim a beautiful pearl.  The master of the galley weighed them, and put\\nthem into a little bag of green leather.\\n\\nThe young King tried to speak, but his tongue seemed to cleave to the\\nroof of his mouth, and his lips refused to move.  The negroes chattered\\nto each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads.  Two\\ncranes flew round and round the vessel.\\n\\nThen the diver came up for the last time, and the pearl that he brought\\nwith him was fairer than all the pearls of Ormuz, for it was shaped like\\nthe full moon, and whiter than the morning star.  But his face was\\nstrangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his\\nears and nostrils.  He quivered for a little, and then he was still.  The\\nnegroes shrugged their shoulders, and threw the body overboard.\\n\\nAnd the master of the galley laughed, and, reaching out, he took the\\npearl, and when he saw it he pressed it to his forehead and bowed.  ‘It\\nshall be,’ he said, ‘for the sceptre of the young King,’ and he made a\\nsign to the negroes to draw up the anchor.\\n\\nAnd when the young King heard this he gave a great cry, and woke, and\\nthrough the window he saw the long grey fingers of the dawn clutching at\\nthe fading stars.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd he fell asleep again, and dreamed, and this was his dream.\\n\\nHe thought that he was wandering through a dim wood, hung with strange\\nfruits and with beautiful poisonous flowers.  The adders hissed at him as\\nhe went by, and the bright parrots flew screaming from branch to branch.\\nHuge tortoises lay asleep upon the hot mud.  The trees were full of apes\\nand peacocks.\\n\\nOn and on he went, till he reached the outskirts of the wood, and there\\nhe saw an immense multitude of men toiling in the bed of a dried-up\\nriver.  They swarmed up the crag like ants.  They dug deep pits in the\\nground and went down into them.  Some of them cleft the rocks with great\\naxes; others grabbled in the sand.\\n\\nThey tore up the cactus by its roots, and trampled on the scarlet\\nblossoms.  They hurried about, calling to each other, and no man was\\nidle.\\n\\nFrom the darkness of a cavern Death and Avarice watched them, and Death\\nsaid, ‘I am weary; give me a third of them and let me go.’  But Avarice\\nshook her head.  ‘They are my servants,’ she answered.\\n\\nAnd Death said to her, ‘What hast thou in thy hand?’\\n\\n‘I have three grains of corn,’ she answered; ‘what is that to thee?’\\n\\n‘Give me one of them,’ cried Death, ‘to plant in my garden; only one of\\nthem, and I will go away.’\\n\\n‘I will not give thee anything,’ said Avarice, and she hid her hand in\\nthe fold of her raiment.\\n\\nAnd Death laughed, and took a cup, and dipped it into a pool of water,\\nand out of the cup rose Ague.  She passed through the great multitude,\\nand a third of them lay dead.  A cold mist followed her, and the\\nwater-snakes ran by her side.\\n\\nAnd when Avarice saw that a third of the multitude was dead she beat her\\nbreast and wept.  She beat her barren bosom, and cried aloud.  ‘Thou hast\\nslain a third of my servants,’ she cried, ‘get thee gone.  There is war\\nin the mountains of Tartary, and the kings of each side are calling to\\nthee.  The Afghans have slain the black ox, and are marching to battle.\\nThey have beaten upon their shields with their spears, and have put on\\ntheir helmets of iron.  What is my valley to thee, that thou shouldst\\ntarry in it?  Get thee gone, and come here no more.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ answered Death, ‘but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I\\nwill not go.’\\n\\nBut Avarice shut her hand, and clenched her teeth.  ‘I will not give thee\\nanything,’ she muttered.\\n\\nAnd Death laughed, and took up a black stone, and threw it into the\\nforest, and out of a thicket of wild hemlock came Fever in a robe of\\nflame.  She passed through the multitude, and touched them, and each man\\nthat she touched died.  The grass withered beneath her feet as she\\nwalked.\\n\\nAnd Avarice shuddered, and put ashes on her head.  ‘Thou art cruel,’ she\\ncried; ‘thou art cruel.  There is famine in the walled cities of India,\\nand the cisterns of Samarcand have run dry.  There is famine in the\\nwalled cities of Egypt, and the locusts have come up from the desert.\\nThe Nile has not overflowed its banks, and the priests have cursed Isis\\nand Osiris.  Get thee gone to those who need thee, and leave me my\\nservants.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ answered Death, ‘but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I\\nwill not go.’\\n\\n‘I will not give thee anything,’ said Avarice.\\n\\nAnd Death laughed again, and he whistled through his fingers, and a woman\\ncame flying through the air.  Plague was written upon her forehead, and a\\ncrowd of lean vultures wheeled round her.  She covered the valley with\\nher wings, and no man was left alive.\\n\\nAnd Avarice fled shrieking through the forest, and Death leaped upon his\\nred horse and galloped away, and his galloping was faster than the wind.\\n\\nAnd out of the slime at the bottom of the valley crept dragons and\\nhorrible things with scales, and the jackals came trotting along the\\nsand, sniffing up the air with their nostrils.\\n\\nAnd the young King wept, and said: ‘Who were these men, and for what were\\nthey seeking?’\\n\\n‘For rubies for a king’s crown,’ answered one who stood behind him.\\n\\nAnd the young King started, and, turning round, he saw a man habited as a\\npilgrim and holding in his hand a mirror of silver.\\n\\nAnd he grew pale, and said: ‘For what king?’\\n\\nAnd the pilgrim answered: ‘Look in this mirror, and thou shalt see him.’\\n\\nAnd he looked in the mirror, and, seeing his own face, he gave a great\\ncry and woke, and the bright sunlight was streaming into the room, and\\nfrom the trees of the garden and pleasaunce the birds were singing.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd the Chamberlain and the high officers of State came in and made\\nobeisance to him, and the pages brought him the robe of tissued gold, and\\nset the crown and the sceptre before him.\\n\\nAnd the young King looked at them, and they were beautiful.  More\\nbeautiful were they than aught that he had ever seen.  But he remembered\\nhis dreams, and he said to his lords: ‘Take these things away, for I will\\nnot wear them.’\\n\\nAnd the courtiers were amazed, and some of them laughed, for they thought\\nthat he was jesting.\\n\\nBut he spake sternly to them again, and said: ‘Take these things away,\\nand hide them from me.  Though it be the day of my coronation, I will not\\nwear them.  For on the loom of Sorrow, and by the white hands of Pain,\\nhas this my robe been woven.  There is Blood in the heart of the ruby,\\nand Death in the heart of the pearl.’  And he told them his three dreams.\\n\\nAnd when the courtiers heard them they looked at each other and\\nwhispered, saying: ‘Surely he is mad; for what is a dream but a dream,\\nand a vision but a vision?  They are not real things that one should heed\\nthem.  And what have we to do with the lives of those who toil for us?\\nShall a man not eat bread till he has seen the sower, nor drink wine till\\nhe has talked with the vinedresser?’\\n\\nAnd the Chamberlain spake to the young King, and said, ‘My lord, I pray\\nthee set aside these black thoughts of thine, and put on this fair robe,\\nand set this crown upon thy head.  For how shall the people know that\\nthou art a king, if thou hast not a king’s raiment?’\\n\\nAnd the young King looked at him.  ‘Is it so, indeed?’ he questioned.\\n‘Will they not know me for a king if I have not a king’s raiment?’\\n\\n‘They will not know thee, my lord,’ cried the Chamberlain.\\n\\n‘I had thought that there had been men who were kinglike,’ he answered,\\n‘but it may be as thou sayest.  And yet I will not wear this robe, nor\\nwill I be crowned with this crown, but even as I came to the palace so\\nwill I go forth from it.’\\n\\nAnd he bade them all leave him, save one page whom he kept as his\\ncompanion, a lad a year younger than himself.  Him he kept for his\\nservice, and when he had bathed himself in clear water, he opened a great\\npainted chest, and from it he took the leathern tunic and rough sheepskin\\ncloak that he had worn when he had watched on the hillside the shaggy\\ngoats of the goatherd.  These he put on, and in his hand he took his rude\\nshepherd’s staff.\\n\\nAnd the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said smiling\\nto him, ‘My lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where is thy\\ncrown?’\\n\\nAnd the young King plucked a spray of wild briar that was climbing over\\nthe balcony, and bent it, and made a circlet of it, and set it on his own\\nhead.\\n\\n‘This shall he my crown,’ he answered.\\n\\nAnd thus attired he passed out of his chamber into the Great Hall, where\\nthe nobles were waiting for him.\\n\\nAnd the nobles made merry, and some of them cried out to him, ‘My lord,\\nthe people wait for their king, and thou showest them a beggar,’ and\\nothers were wroth and said, ‘He brings shame upon our state, and is\\nunworthy to be our master.’  But he answered them not a word, but passed\\non, and went down the bright porphyry staircase, and out through the\\ngates of bronze, and mounted upon his horse, and rode towards the\\ncathedral, the little page running beside him.\\n\\nAnd the people laughed and said, ‘It is the King’s fool who is riding\\nby,’ and they mocked him.\\n\\nAnd he drew rein and said, ‘Nay, but I am the King.’  And he told them\\nhis three dreams.\\n\\nAnd a man came out of the crowd and spake bitterly to him, and said,\\n‘Sir, knowest thou not that out of the luxury of the rich cometh the life\\nof the poor?  By your pomp we are nurtured, and your vices give us bread.\\nTo toil for a hard master is bitter, but to have no master to toil for is\\nmore bitter still.  Thinkest thou that the ravens will feed us?  And what\\ncure hast thou for these things?  Wilt thou say to the buyer, “Thou shalt\\nbuy for so much,” and to the seller, “Thou shalt sell at this price”?  I\\ntrow not.  Therefore go back to thy Palace and put on thy purple and fine\\nlinen.  What hast thou to do with us, and what we suffer?’\\n\\n‘Are not the rich and the poor brothers?’ asked the young King.\\n\\n‘Ay,’ answered the man, ‘and the name of the rich brother is Cain.’\\n\\nAnd the young King’s eyes filled with tears, and he rode on through the\\nmurmurs of the people, and the little page grew afraid and left him.\\n\\nAnd when he reached the great portal of the cathedral, the soldiers\\nthrust their halberts out and said, ‘What dost thou seek here?  None\\nenters by this door but the King.’\\n\\nAnd his face flushed with anger, and he said to them, ‘I am the King,’\\nand waved their halberts aside and passed in.\\n\\nAnd when the old Bishop saw him coming in his goatherd’s dress, he rose\\nup in wonder from his throne, and went to meet him, and said to him, ‘My\\nson, is this a king’s apparel?  And with what crown shall I crown thee,\\nand what sceptre shall I place in thy hand?  Surely this should be to\\nthee a day of joy, and not a day of abasement.’\\n\\n‘Shall Joy wear what Grief has fashioned?’ said the young King.  And he\\ntold him his three dreams.\\n\\nAnd when the Bishop had heard them he knit his brows, and said, ‘My son,\\nI am an old man, and in the winter of my days, and I know that many evil\\nthings are done in the wide world.  The fierce robbers come down from the\\nmountains, and carry off the little children, and sell them to the Moors.\\nThe lions lie in wait for the caravans, and leap upon the camels.  The\\nwild boar roots up the corn in the valley, and the foxes gnaw the vines\\nupon the hill.  The pirates lay waste the sea-coast and burn the ships of\\nthe fishermen, and take their nets from them.  In the salt-marshes live\\nthe lepers; they have houses of wattled reeds, and none may come nigh\\nthem.  The beggars wander through the cities, and eat their food with the\\ndogs.  Canst thou make these things not to be?  Wilt thou take the leper\\nfor thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board?  Shall the lion do\\nthy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee?  Is not He who made misery\\nwiser than thou art?  Wherefore I praise thee not for this that thou hast\\ndone, but I bid thee ride back to the Palace and make thy face glad, and\\nput on the raiment that beseemeth a king, and with the crown of gold I\\nwill crown thee, and the sceptre of pearl will I place in thy hand.  And\\nas for thy dreams, think no more of them.  The burden of this world is\\ntoo great for one man to bear, and the world’s sorrow too heavy for one\\nheart to suffer.’\\n\\n‘Sayest thou that in this house?’ said the young King, and he strode past\\nthe Bishop, and climbed up the steps of the altar, and stood before the\\nimage of Christ.\\n\\nHe stood before the image of Christ, and on his right hand and on his\\nleft were the marvellous vessels of gold, the chalice with the yellow\\nwine, and the vial with the holy oil.  He knelt before the image of\\nChrist, and the great candles burned brightly by the jewelled shrine, and\\nthe smoke of the incense curled in thin blue wreaths through the dome.\\nHe bowed his head in prayer, and the priests in their stiff copes crept\\naway from the altar.\\n\\nAnd suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside, and in entered\\nthe nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes, and shields of polished\\nsteel.  ‘Where is this dreamer of dreams?’ they cried.  ‘Where is this\\nKing who is apparelled like a beggar—this boy who brings shame upon our\\nstate?  Surely we will slay him, for he is unworthy to rule over us.’\\n\\nAnd the young King bowed his head again, and prayed, and when he had\\nfinished his prayer he rose up, and turning round he looked at them\\nsadly.\\n\\nAnd lo! through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming upon him,\\nand the sun-beams wove round him a tissued robe that was fairer than the\\nrobe that had been fashioned for his pleasure.  The dead staff blossomed,\\nand bare lilies that were whiter than pearls.  The dry thorn blossomed,\\nand bare roses that were redder than rubies.  Whiter than fine pearls\\nwere the lilies, and their stems were of bright silver.  Redder than male\\nrubies were the roses, and their leaves were of beaten gold.\\n\\nHe stood there in the raiment of a king, and the gates of the jewelled\\nshrine flew open, and from the crystal of the many-rayed monstrance shone\\na marvellous and mystical light.  He stood there in a king’s raiment, and\\nthe Glory of God filled the place, and the saints in their carven niches\\nseemed to move.  In the fair raiment of a king he stood before them, and\\nthe organ pealed out its music, and the trumpeters blew upon their\\ntrumpets, and the singing boys sang.\\n\\nAnd the people fell upon their knees in awe, and the nobles sheathed\\ntheir swords and did homage, and the Bishop’s face grew pale, and his\\nhands trembled.  ‘A greater than I hath crowned thee,’ he cried, and he\\nknelt before him.\\n\\nAnd the young King came down from the high altar, and passed home through\\nthe midst of the people.  But no man dared look upon his face, for it was\\nlike the face of an angel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BIRTHDAY OF THE INFANTA\\n\\n\\n                                    TO\\n                         MRS. WILLIAM H. GRENFELL\\n                             OF TAPLOW COURT\\n                            [LADY DESBOROUGH]\\n\\nIT was the birthday of the Infanta.  She was just twelve years of age,\\nand the sun was shining brightly in the gardens of the palace.\\n\\nAlthough she was a real Princess and the Infanta of Spain, she had only\\none birthday every year, just like the children of quite poor people, so\\nit was naturally a matter of great importance to the whole country that\\nshe should have a really fine day for the occasion.  And a really fine\\nday it certainly was.  The tall striped tulips stood straight up upon\\ntheir stalks, like long rows of soldiers, and looked defiantly across the\\ngrass at the roses, and said: ‘We are quite as splendid as you are now.’\\nThe purple butterflies fluttered about with gold dust on their wings,\\nvisiting each flower in turn; the little lizards crept out of the\\ncrevices of the wall, and lay basking in the white glare; and the\\npomegranates split and cracked with the heat, and showed their bleeding\\nred hearts.  Even the pale yellow lemons, that hung in such profusion\\nfrom the mouldering trellis and along the dim arcades, seemed to have\\ncaught a richer colour from the wonderful sunlight, and the magnolia\\ntrees opened their great globe-like blossoms of folded ivory, and filled\\nthe air with a sweet heavy perfume.\\n\\nThe little Princess herself walked up and down the terrace with her\\ncompanions, and played at hide and seek round the stone vases and the old\\nmoss-grown statues.  On ordinary days she was only allowed to play with\\nchildren of her own rank, so she had always to play alone, but her\\nbirthday was an exception, and the King had given orders that she was to\\ninvite any of her young friends whom she liked to come and amuse\\nthemselves with her.  There was a stately grace about these slim Spanish\\nchildren as they glided about, the boys with their large-plumed hats and\\nshort fluttering cloaks, the girls holding up the trains of their long\\nbrocaded gowns, and shielding the sun from their eyes with huge fans of\\nblack and silver.  But the Infanta was the most graceful of all, and the\\nmost tastefully attired, after the somewhat cumbrous fashion of the day.\\nHer robe was of grey satin, the skirt and the wide puffed sleeves heavily\\nembroidered with silver, and the stiff corset studded with rows of fine\\npearls.  Two tiny slippers with big pink rosettes peeped out beneath her\\ndress as she walked.  Pink and pearl was her great gauze fan, and in her\\nhair, which like an aureole of faded gold stood out stiffly round her\\npale little face, she had a beautiful white rose.\\n\\nFrom a window in the palace the sad melancholy King watched them.  Behind\\nhim stood his brother, Don Pedro of Aragon, whom he hated, and his\\nconfessor, the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, sat by his side.  Sadder even\\nthan usual was the King, for as he looked at the Infanta bowing with\\nchildish gravity to the assembling counters, or laughing behind her fan\\nat the grim Duchess of Albuquerque who always accompanied her, he thought\\nof the young Queen, her mother, who but a short time before—so it seemed\\nto him—had come from the gay country of France, and had withered away in\\nthe sombre splendour of the Spanish court, dying just six months after\\nthe birth of her child, and before she had seen the almonds blossom twice\\nin the orchard, or plucked the second year’s fruit from the old gnarled\\nfig-tree that stood in the centre of the now grass-grown courtyard.  So\\ngreat had been his love for her that he had not suffered even the grave\\nto hide her from him.  She had been embalmed by a Moorish physician, who\\nin return for this service had been granted his life, which for heresy\\nand suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited, men said,\\nto the Holy Office, and her body was still lying on its tapestried bier\\nin the black marble chapel of the Palace, just as the monks had borne her\\nin on that windy March day nearly twelve years before.  Once every month\\nthe King, wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand,\\nwent in and knelt by her side calling out, ‘_Mi reina_!  _Mi reina_!’ and\\nsometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in Spain governs\\nevery separate action of life, and sets limits even to the sorrow of a\\nKing, he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of\\ngrief, and try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face.\\n\\nTo-day he seemed to see her again, as he had seen her first at the Castle\\nof Fontainebleau, when he was but fifteen years of age, and she still\\nyounger.  They had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the Papal\\nNuncio in the presence of the French King and all the Court, and he had\\nreturned to the Escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow\\nhair, and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand\\nas he stepped into his carriage.  Later on had followed the marriage,\\nhastily performed at Burgos, a small town on the frontier between the two\\ncountries, and the grand public entry into Madrid with the customary\\ncelebration of high mass at the Church of La Atocha, and a more than\\nusually solemn _auto-da-fé_, in which nearly three hundred heretics,\\namongst whom were many Englishmen, had been delivered over to the secular\\narm to be burned.\\n\\nCertainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many thought, of his\\ncountry, then at war with England for the possession of the empire of the\\nNew World.  He had hardly ever permitted her to be out of his sight; for\\nher, he had forgotten, or seemed to have forgotten, all grave affairs of\\nState; and, with that terrible blindness that passion brings upon its\\nservants, he had failed to notice that the elaborate ceremonies by which\\nhe sought to please her did but aggravate the strange malady from which\\nshe suffered.  When she died he was, for a time, like one bereft of\\nreason.  Indeed, there is no doubt but that he would have formally\\nabdicated and retired to the great Trappist monastery at Granada, of\\nwhich he was already titular Prior, had he not been afraid to leave the\\nlittle Infanta at the mercy of his brother, whose cruelty, even in Spain,\\nwas notorious, and who was suspected by many of having caused the Queen’s\\ndeath by means of a pair of poisoned gloves that he had presented to her\\non the occasion of her visiting his castle in Aragon.  Even after the\\nexpiration of the three years of public mourning that he had ordained\\nthroughout his whole dominions by royal edict, he would never suffer his\\nministers to speak about any new alliance, and when the Emperor himself\\nsent to him, and offered him the hand of the lovely Archduchess of\\nBohemia, his niece, in marriage, he bade the ambassadors tell their\\nmaster that the King of Spain was already wedded to Sorrow, and that\\nthough she was but a barren bride he loved her better than Beauty; an\\nanswer that cost his crown the rich provinces of the Netherlands, which\\nsoon after, at the Emperor’s instigation, revolted against him under the\\nleadership of some fanatics of the Reformed Church.\\n\\nHis whole married life, with its fierce, fiery-coloured joys and the\\nterrible agony of its sudden ending, seemed to come back to him to-day as\\nhe watched the Infanta playing on the terrace.  She had all the Queen’s\\npretty petulance of manner, the same wilful way of tossing her head, the\\nsame proud curved beautiful mouth, the same wonderful smile—_vrai sourire\\nde France_ indeed—as she glanced up now and then at the window, or\\nstretched out her little hand for the stately Spanish gentlemen to kiss.\\nBut the shrill laughter of the children grated on his ears, and the\\nbright pitiless sunlight mocked his sorrow, and a dull odour of strange\\nspices, spices such as embalmers use, seemed to taint—or was it\\nfancy?—the clear morning air.  He buried his face in his hands, and when\\nthe Infanta looked up again the curtains had been drawn, and the King had\\nretired.\\n\\nShe made a little _moue_ of disappointment, and shrugged her shoulders.\\nSurely he might have stayed with her on her birthday.  What did the\\nstupid State-affairs matter?  Or had he gone to that gloomy chapel, where\\nthe candles were always burning, and where she was never allowed to\\nenter?  How silly of him, when the sun was shining so brightly, and\\neverybody was so happy!  Besides, he would miss the sham bull-fight for\\nwhich the trumpet was already sounding, to say nothing of the puppet-show\\nand the other wonderful things.  Her uncle and the Grand Inquisitor were\\nmuch more sensible.  They had come out on the terrace, and paid her nice\\ncompliments.  So she tossed her pretty head, and taking Don Pedro by the\\nhand, she walked slowly down the steps towards a long pavilion of purple\\nsilk that had been erected at the end of the garden, the other children\\nfollowing in strict order of precedence, those who had the longest names\\ngoing first.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nA procession of noble boys, fantastically dressed as _toreadors_, came\\nout to meet her, and the young Count of Tierra-Nueva, a wonderfully\\nhandsome lad of about fourteen years of age, uncovering his head with all\\nthe grace of a born hidalgo and grandee of Spain, led her solemnly in to\\na little gilt and ivory chair that was placed on a raised dais above the\\narena.  The children grouped themselves all round, fluttering their big\\nfans and whispering to each other, and Don Pedro and the Grand Inquisitor\\nstood laughing at the entrance.  Even the Duchess—the Camerera-Mayor as\\nshe was called—a thin, hard-featured woman with a yellow ruff, did not\\nlook quite so bad-tempered as usual, and something like a chill smile\\nflitted across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless lips.\\n\\nIt certainly was a marvellous bull-fight, and much nicer, the Infanta\\nthought, than the real bull-fight that she had been brought to see at\\nSeville, on the occasion of the visit of the Duke of Parma to her father.\\nSome of the boys pranced about on richly-caparisoned hobby-horses\\nbrandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached\\nto them; others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull,\\nand vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them; and as for\\nthe bull himself, he was just like a live bull, though he was only made\\nof wicker-work and stretched hide, and sometimes insisted on running\\nround the arena on his hind legs, which no live bull ever dreams of\\ndoing.  He made a splendid fight of it too, and the children got so\\nexcited that they stood up upon the benches, and waved their lace\\nhandkerchiefs and cried out: _Bravo toro_!  _Bravo toro_! just as\\nsensibly as if they had been grown-up people.  At last, however, after a\\nprolonged combat, during which several of the hobby-horses were gored\\nthrough and through, and, their riders dismounted, the young Count of\\nTierra-Nueva brought the bull to his knees, and having obtained\\npermission from the Infanta to give the _coup de grâce_, he plunged his\\nwooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head\\ncame right off, and disclosed the laughing face of little Monsieur de\\nLorraine, the son of the French Ambassador at Madrid.\\n\\nThe arena was then cleared amidst much applause, and the dead\\nhobby-horses dragged solemnly away by two Moorish pages in yellow and\\nblack liveries, and after a short interlude, during which a French\\nposture-master performed upon the tightrope, some Italian puppets\\nappeared in the semi-classical tragedy of _Sophonisba_ on the stage of a\\nsmall theatre that had been built up for the purpose.  They acted so\\nwell, and their gestures were so extremely natural, that at the close of\\nthe play the eyes of the Infanta were quite dim with tears.  Indeed some\\nof the children really cried, and had to be comforted with sweetmeats,\\nand the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help\\nsaying to Don Pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made\\nsimply out of wood and coloured wax, and worked mechanically by wires,\\nshould be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes.\\n\\nAn African juggler followed, who brought in a large flat basket covered\\nwith a red cloth, and having placed it in the centre of the arena, he\\ntook from his turban a curious reed pipe, and blew through it.  In a few\\nmoments the cloth began to move, and as the pipe grew shriller and\\nshriller two green and gold snakes put out their strange wedge-shaped\\nheads and rose slowly up, swaying to and fro with the music as a plant\\nsways in the water.  The children, however, were rather frightened at\\ntheir spotted hoods and quick darting tongues, and were much more pleased\\nwhen the juggler made a tiny orange-tree grow out of the sand and bear\\npretty white blossoms and clusters of real fruit; and when he took the\\nfan of the little daughter of the Marquess de Las-Torres, and changed it\\ninto a blue bird that flew all round the pavilion and sang, their delight\\nand amazement knew no bounds.  The solemn minuet, too, performed by the\\ndancing boys from the church of Nuestra Senora Del Pilar, was charming.\\nThe Infanta had never before seen this wonderful ceremony which takes\\nplace every year at Maytime in front of the high altar of the Virgin, and\\nin her honour; and indeed none of the royal family of Spain had entered\\nthe great cathedral of Saragossa since a mad priest, supposed by many to\\nhave been in the pay of Elizabeth of England, had tried to administer a\\npoisoned wafer to the Prince of the Asturias.  So she had known only by\\nhearsay of ‘Our Lady’s Dance,’ as it was called, and it certainly was a\\nbeautiful sight.  The boys wore old-fashioned court dresses of white\\nvelvet, and their curious three-cornered hats were fringed with silver\\nand surmounted with huge plumes of ostrich feathers, the dazzling\\nwhiteness of their costumes, as they moved about in the sunlight, being\\nstill more accentuated by their swarthy faces and long black hair.\\nEverybody was fascinated by the grave dignity with which they moved\\nthrough the intricate figures of the dance, and by the elaborate grace of\\ntheir slow gestures, and stately bows, and when they had finished their\\nperformance and doffed their great plumed hats to the Infanta, she\\nacknowledged their reverence with much courtesy, and made a vow that she\\nwould send a large wax candle to the shrine of Our Lady of Pilar in\\nreturn for the pleasure that she had given her.\\n\\nA troop of handsome Egyptians—as the gipsies were termed in those\\ndays—then advanced into the arena, and sitting down cross-legs, in a\\ncircle, began to play softly upon their zithers, moving their bodies to\\nthe tune, and humming, almost below their breath, a low dreamy air.  When\\nthey caught sight of Don Pedro they scowled at him, and some of them\\nlooked terrified, for only a few weeks before he had had two of their\\ntribe hanged for sorcery in the market-place at Seville, but the pretty\\nInfanta charmed them as she leaned back peeping over her fan with her\\ngreat blue eyes, and they felt sure that one so lovely as she was could\\nnever be cruel to anybody.  So they played on very gently and just\\ntouching the cords of the zithers with their long pointed nails, and\\ntheir heads began to nod as though they were falling asleep.  Suddenly,\\nwith a cry so shrill that all the children were startled and Don Pedro’s\\nhand clutched at the agate pommel of his dagger, they leapt to their feet\\nand whirled madly round the enclosure beating their tambourines, and\\nchaunting some wild love-song in their strange guttural language.  Then\\nat another signal they all flung themselves again to the ground and lay\\nthere quite still, the dull strumming of the zithers being the only sound\\nthat broke the silence.  After that they had done this several times,\\nthey disappeared for a moment and came back leading a brown shaggy bear\\nby a chain, and carrying on their shoulders some little Barbary apes.\\nThe bear stood upon his head with the utmost gravity, and the wizened\\napes played all kinds of amusing tricks with two gipsy boys who seemed to\\nbe their masters, and fought with tiny swords, and fired off guns, and\\nwent through a regular soldier’s drill just like the King’s own\\nbodyguard.  In fact the gipsies were a great success.\\n\\nBut the funniest part of the whole morning’s entertainment, was\\nundoubtedly the dancing of the little Dwarf.  When he stumbled into the\\narena, waddling on his crooked legs and wagging his huge misshapen head\\nfrom side to side, the children went off into a loud shout of delight,\\nand the Infanta herself laughed so much that the Camerera was obliged to\\nremind her that although there were many precedents in Spain for a King’s\\ndaughter weeping before her equals, there were none for a Princess of the\\nblood royal making so merry before those who were her inferiors in birth.\\nThe Dwarf, however, was really quite irresistible, and even at the\\nSpanish Court, always noted for its cultivated passion for the horrible,\\nso fantastic a little monster had never been seen.  It was his first\\nappearance, too.  He had been discovered only the day before, running\\nwild through the forest, by two of the nobles who happened to have been\\nhunting in a remote part of the great cork-wood that surrounded the town,\\nand had been carried off by them to the Palace as a surprise for the\\nInfanta; his father, who was a poor charcoal-burner, being but too well\\npleased to get rid of so ugly and useless a child.  Perhaps the most\\namusing thing about him was his complete unconsciousness of his own\\ngrotesque appearance.  Indeed he seemed quite happy and full of the\\nhighest spirits.  When the children laughed, he laughed as freely and as\\njoyously as any of them, and at the close of each dance he made them each\\nthe funniest of bows, smiling and nodding at them just as if he was\\nreally one of themselves, and not a little misshapen thing that Nature,\\nin some humourous mood, had fashioned for others to mock at.  As for the\\nInfanta, she absolutely fascinated him.  He could not keep his eyes off\\nher, and seemed to dance for her alone, and when at the close of the\\nperformance, remembering how she had seen the great ladies of the Court\\nthrow bouquets to Caffarelli, the famous Italian treble, whom the Pope\\nhad sent from his own chapel to Madrid that he might cure the King’s\\nmelancholy by the sweetness of his voice, she took out of her hair the\\nbeautiful white rose, and partly for a jest and partly to tease the\\nCamerera, threw it to him across the arena with her sweetest smile, he\\ntook the whole matter quite seriously, and pressing the flower to his\\nrough coarse lips he put his hand upon his heart, and sank on one knee\\nbefore her, grinning from ear to ear, and with his little bright eyes\\nsparkling with pleasure.\\n\\nThis so upset the gravity of the Infanta that she kept on laughing long\\nafter the little Dwarf had ran out of the arena, and expressed a desire\\nto her uncle that the dance should be immediately repeated.  The\\nCamerera, however, on the plea that the sun was too hot, decided that it\\nwould be better that her Highness should return without delay to the\\nPalace, where a wonderful feast had been already prepared for her,\\nincluding a real birthday cake with her own initials worked all over it\\nin painted sugar and a lovely silver flag waving from the top.  The\\nInfanta accordingly rose up with much dignity, and having given orders\\nthat the little dwarf was to dance again for her after the hour of\\nsiesta, and conveyed her thanks to the young Count of Tierra-Nueva for\\nhis charming reception, she went back to her apartments, the children\\nfollowing in the same order in which they had entered.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nNow when the little Dwarf heard that he was to dance a second time before\\nthe Infanta, and by her own express command, he was so proud that he ran\\nout into the garden, kissing the white rose in an absurd ecstasy of\\npleasure, and making the most uncouth and clumsy gestures of delight.\\n\\nThe Flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude into their\\nbeautiful home, and when they saw him capering up and down the walks, and\\nwaving his arms above his head in such a ridiculous manner, they could\\nnot restrain their feelings any longer.\\n\\n‘He is really far too ugly to be allowed to play in any place where we\\nare,’ cried the Tulips.\\n\\n‘He should drink poppy-juice, and go to sleep for a thousand years,’ said\\nthe great scarlet Lilies, and they grew quite hot and angry.\\n\\n‘He is a perfect horror!’ screamed the Cactus.  ‘Why, he is twisted and\\nstumpy, and his head is completely out of proportion with his legs.\\nReally he makes me feel prickly all over, and if he comes near me I will\\nsting him with my thorns.’\\n\\n‘And he has actually got one of my best blooms,’ exclaimed the White\\nRose-Tree.  ‘I gave it to the Infanta this morning myself, as a birthday\\npresent, and he has stolen it from her.’  And she called out: ‘Thief,\\nthief, thief!’ at the top of her voice.\\n\\nEven the red Geraniums, who did not usually give themselves airs, and\\nwere known to have a great many poor relations themselves, curled up in\\ndisgust when they saw him, and when the Violets meekly remarked that\\nthough he was certainly extremely plain, still he could not help it, they\\nretorted with a good deal of justice that that was his chief defect, and\\nthat there was no reason why one should admire a person because he was\\nincurable; and, indeed, some of the Violets themselves felt that the\\nugliness of the little Dwarf was almost ostentatious, and that he would\\nhave shown much better taste if he had looked sad, or at least pensive,\\ninstead of jumping about merrily, and throwing himself into such\\ngrotesque and silly attitudes.\\n\\nAs for the old Sundial, who was an extremely remarkable individual, and\\nhad once told the time of day to no less a person than the Emperor\\nCharles V. himself, he was so taken aback by the little Dwarf’s\\nappearance, that he almost forgot to mark two whole minutes with his long\\nshadowy finger, and could not help saying to the great milk-white\\nPeacock, who was sunning herself on the balustrade, that every one knew\\nthat the children of Kings were Kings, and that the children of\\ncharcoal-burners were charcoal-burners, and that it was absurd to pretend\\nthat it wasn’t so; a statement with which the Peacock entirely agreed,\\nand indeed screamed out, ‘Certainly, certainly,’ in such a loud, harsh\\nvoice, that the gold-fish who lived in the basin of the cool splashing\\nfountain put their heads out of the water, and asked the huge stone\\nTritons what on earth was the matter.\\n\\nBut somehow the Birds liked him.  They had seen him often in the forest,\\ndancing about like an elf after the eddying leaves, or crouched up in the\\nhollow of some old oak-tree, sharing his nuts with the squirrels.  They\\ndid not mind his being ugly, a bit.  Why, even the nightingale herself,\\nwho sang so sweetly in the orange groves at night that sometimes the Moon\\nleaned down to listen, was not much to look at after all; and, besides,\\nhe had been kind to them, and during that terribly bitter winter, when\\nthere were no berries on the trees, and the ground was as hard as iron,\\nand the wolves had come down to the very gates of the city to look for\\nfood, he had never once forgotten them, but had always given them crumbs\\nout of his little hunch of black bread, and divided with them whatever\\npoor breakfast he had.\\n\\nSo they flew round and round him, just touching his cheek with their\\nwings as they passed, and chattered to each other, and the little Dwarf\\nwas so pleased that he could not help showing them the beautiful white\\nrose, and telling them that the Infanta herself had given it to him\\nbecause she loved him.\\n\\nThey did not understand a single word of what he was saying, but that\\nmade no matter, for they put their heads on one side, and looked wise,\\nwhich is quite as good as understanding a thing, and very much easier.\\n\\nThe Lizards also took an immense fancy to him, and when he grew tired of\\nrunning about and flung himself down on the grass to rest, they played\\nand romped all over him, and tried to amuse him in the best way they\\ncould.  ‘Every one cannot be as beautiful as a lizard,’ they cried; ‘that\\nwould be too much to expect.  And, though it sounds absurd to say so, he\\nis really not so ugly after all, provided, of course, that one shuts\\none’s eyes, and does not look at him.’  The Lizards were extremely\\nphilosophical by nature, and often sat thinking for hours and hours\\ntogether, when there was nothing else to do, or when the weather was too\\nrainy for them to go out.\\n\\nThe Flowers, however, were excessively annoyed at their behaviour, and at\\nthe behaviour of the birds.  ‘It only shows,’ they said, ‘what a\\nvulgarising effect this incessant rushing and flying about has.\\nWell-bred people always stay exactly in the same place, as we do.  No one\\never saw us hopping up and down the walks, or galloping madly through the\\ngrass after dragon-flies.  When we do want change of air, we send for the\\ngardener, and he carries us to another bed.  This is dignified, and as it\\nshould be.  But birds and lizards have no sense of repose, and indeed\\nbirds have not even a permanent address.  They are mere vagrants like the\\ngipsies, and should be treated in exactly the same manner.’  So they put\\ntheir noses in the air, and looked very haughty, and were quite delighted\\nwhen after some time they saw the little Dwarf scramble up from the\\ngrass, and make his way across the terrace to the palace.\\n\\n‘He should certainly be kept indoors for the rest of his natural life,’\\nthey said.  ‘Look at his hunched back, and his crooked legs,’ and they\\nbegan to titter.\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf knew nothing of all this.  He liked the birds and\\nthe lizards immensely, and thought that the flowers were the most\\nmarvellous things in the whole world, except of course the Infanta, but\\nthen she had given him the beautiful white rose, and she loved him, and\\nthat made a great difference.  How he wished that he had gone back with\\nher!  She would have put him on her right hand, and smiled at him, and he\\nwould have never left her side, but would have made her his playmate, and\\ntaught her all kinds of delightful tricks.  For though he had never been\\nin a palace before, he knew a great many wonderful things.  He could make\\nlittle cages out of rushes for the grasshoppers to sing in, and fashion\\nthe long jointed bamboo into the pipe that Pan loves to hear.  He knew\\nthe cry of every bird, and could call the starlings from the tree-top, or\\nthe heron from the mere.  He knew the trail of every animal, and could\\ntrack the hare by its delicate footprints, and the boar by the trampled\\nleaves.  All the wild-dances he knew, the mad dance in red raiment with\\nthe autumn, the light dance in blue sandals over the corn, the dance with\\nwhite snow-wreaths in winter, and the blossom-dance through the orchards\\nin spring.  He knew where the wood-pigeons built their nests, and once\\nwhen a fowler had snared the parent birds, he had brought up the young\\nones himself, and had built a little dovecot for them in the cleft of a\\npollard elm.  They were quite tame, and used to feed out of his hands\\nevery morning.  She would like them, and the rabbits that scurried about\\nin the long fern, and the jays with their steely feathers and black\\nbills, and the hedgehogs that could curl themselves up into prickly\\nballs, and the great wise tortoises that crawled slowly about, shaking\\ntheir heads and nibbling at the young leaves.  Yes, she must certainly\\ncome to the forest and play with him.  He would give her his own little\\nbed, and would watch outside the window till dawn, to see that the wild\\nhorned cattle did not harm her, nor the gaunt wolves creep too near the\\nhut.  And at dawn he would tap at the shutters and wake her, and they\\nwould go out and dance together all the day long.  It was really not a\\nbit lonely in the forest.  Sometimes a Bishop rode through on his white\\nmule, reading out of a painted book.  Sometimes in their green velvet\\ncaps, and their jerkins of tanned deerskin, the falconers passed by, with\\nhooded hawks on their wrists.  At vintage-time came the grape-treaders,\\nwith purple hands and feet, wreathed with glossy ivy and carrying\\ndripping skins of wine; and the charcoal-burners sat round their huge\\nbraziers at night, watching the dry logs charring slowly in the fire, and\\nroasting chestnuts in the ashes, and the robbers came out of their caves\\nand made merry with them.  Once, too, he had seen a beautiful procession\\nwinding up the long dusty road to Toledo.  The monks went in front\\nsinging sweetly, and carrying bright banners and crosses of gold, and\\nthen, in silver armour, with matchlocks and pikes, came the soldiers, and\\nin their midst walked three barefooted men, in strange yellow dresses\\npainted all over with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in\\ntheir hands.  Certainly there was a great deal to look at in the forest,\\nand when she was tired he would find a soft bank of moss for her, or\\ncarry her in his arms, for he was very strong, though he knew that he was\\nnot tall.  He would make her a necklace of red bryony berries, that would\\nbe quite as pretty as the white berries that she wore on her dress, and\\nwhen she was tired of them, she could throw them away, and he would find\\nher others.  He would bring her acorn-cups and dew-drenched anemones, and\\ntiny glow-worms to be stars in the pale gold of her hair.\\n\\nBut where was she?  He asked the white rose, and it made him no answer.\\nThe whole palace seemed asleep, and even where the shutters had not been\\nclosed, heavy curtains had been drawn across the windows to keep out the\\nglare.  He wandered all round looking for some place through which he\\nmight gain an entrance, and at last he caught sight of a little private\\ndoor that was lying open.  He slipped through, and found himself in a\\nsplendid hall, far more splendid, he feared, than the forest, there was\\nso much more gilding everywhere, and even the floor was made of great\\ncoloured stones, fitted together into a sort of geometrical pattern.  But\\nthe little Infanta was not there, only some wonderful white statues that\\nlooked down on him from their jasper pedestals, with sad blank eyes and\\nstrangely smiling lips.\\n\\nAt the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of black velvet,\\npowdered with suns and stars, the King’s favourite devices, and broidered\\non the colour he loved best.  Perhaps she was hiding behind that?  He\\nwould try at any rate.\\n\\nSo he stole quietly across, and drew it aside.  No; there was only\\nanother room, though a prettier room, he thought, than the one he had\\njust left.  The walls were hung with a many-figured green arras of\\nneedle-wrought tapestry representing a hunt, the work of some Flemish\\nartists who had spent more than seven years in its composition.  It had\\nonce been the chamber of _Jean le Fou_, as he was called, that mad King\\nwho was so enamoured of the chase, that he had often tried in his\\ndelirium to mount the huge rearing horses, and to drag down the stag on\\nwhich the great hounds were leaping, sounding his hunting horn, and\\nstabbing with his dagger at the pale flying deer.  It was now used as the\\ncouncil-room, and on the centre table were lying the red portfolios of\\nthe ministers, stamped with the gold tulips of Spain, and with the arms\\nand emblems of the house of Hapsburg.\\n\\nThe little Dwarf looked in wonder all round him, and was half-afraid to\\ngo on.  The strange silent horsemen that galloped so swiftly through the\\nlong glades without making any noise, seemed to him like those terrible\\nphantoms of whom he had heard the charcoal-burners speaking—the\\nComprachos, who hunt only at night, and if they meet a man, turn him into\\na hind, and chase him.  But he thought of the pretty Infanta, and took\\ncourage.  He wanted to find her alone, and to tell her that he too loved\\nher.  Perhaps she was in the room beyond.\\n\\nHe ran across the soft Moorish carpets, and opened the door.  No!  She\\nwas not here either.  The room was quite empty.\\n\\nIt was a throne-room, used for the reception of foreign ambassadors, when\\nthe King, which of late had not been often, consented to give them a\\npersonal audience; the same room in which, many years before, envoys had\\nappeared from England to make arrangements for the marriage of their\\nQueen, then one of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe, with the Emperor’s\\neldest son.  The hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt\\nchandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the\\nblack and white ceiling.  Underneath a great canopy of gold cloth, on\\nwhich the lions and towers of Castile were broidered in seed pearls,\\nstood the throne itself, covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded\\nwith silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls.  On\\nthe second step of the throne was placed the kneeling-stool of the\\nInfanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and below that\\nagain, and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the Papal\\nNuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King’s presence on\\nthe occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal’s hat, with its\\ntangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple _tabouret_ in front.  On the\\nwall, facing the throne, hung a life-sized portrait of Charles V. in\\nhunting dress, with a great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Philip\\nII. receiving the homage of the Netherlands occupied the centre of the\\nother wall.  Between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet, inlaid with\\nplates of ivory, on which the figures from Holbein’s Dance of Death had\\nbeen graved—by the hand, some said, of that famous master himself.\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence.  He would\\nnot have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy, nor one white\\npetal of his rose for the throne itself.  What he wanted was to see the\\nInfanta before she went down to the pavilion, and to ask her to come away\\nwith him when he had finished his dance.  Here, in the Palace, the air\\nwas close and heavy, but in the forest the wind blew free, and the\\nsunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside.\\nThere were flowers, too, in the forest, not so splendid, perhaps, as the\\nflowers in the garden, but more sweetly scented for all that; hyacinths\\nin early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens, and\\ngrassy knolls; yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the\\ngnarled roots of the oak-trees; bright celandine, and blue speedwell, and\\nirises lilac and gold.  There were grey catkins on the hazels, and the\\nfoxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled bee-haunted cells.\\nThe chestnut had its spires of white stars, and the hawthorn its pallid\\nmoons of beauty.  Yes: surely she would come if he could only find her!\\nShe would come with him to the fair forest, and all day long he would\\ndance for her delight.  A smile lit up his eyes at the thought, and he\\npassed into the next room.\\n\\nOf all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful.  The\\nwalls were covered with a pink-flowered Lucca damask, patterned with\\nbirds and dotted with dainty blossoms of silver; the furniture was of\\nmassive silver, festooned with florid wreaths, and swinging Cupids; in\\nfront of the two large fire-places stood great screens broidered with\\nparrots and peacocks, and the floor, which was of sea-green onyx, seemed\\nto stretch far away into the distance.  Nor was he alone.  Standing under\\nthe shadow of the doorway, at the extreme end of the room, he saw a\\nlittle figure watching him.  His heart trembled, a cry of joy broke from\\nhis lips, and he moved out into the sunlight.  As he did so, the figure\\nmoved out also, and he saw it plainly.\\n\\nThe Infanta!  It was a monster, the most grotesque monster he had ever\\nbeheld.  Not properly shaped, as all other people were, but hunchbacked,\\nand crooked-limbed, with huge lolling head and mane of black hair.  The\\nlittle Dwarf frowned, and the monster frowned also.  He laughed, and it\\nlaughed with him, and held its hands to its sides, just as he himself was\\ndoing.  He made it a mocking bow, and it returned him a low reverence.\\nHe went towards it, and it came to meet him, copying each step that he\\nmade, and stopping when he stopped himself.  He shouted with amusement,\\nand ran forward, and reached out his hand, and the hand of the monster\\ntouched his, and it was as cold as ice.  He grew afraid, and moved his\\nhand across, and the monster’s hand followed it quickly.  He tried to\\npress on, but something smooth and hard stopped him.  The face of the\\nmonster was now close to his own, and seemed full of terror.  He brushed\\nhis hair off his eyes.  It imitated him.  He struck at it, and it\\nreturned blow for blow.  He loathed it, and it made hideous faces at him.\\nHe drew back, and it retreated.\\n\\nWhat is it?  He thought for a moment, and looked round at the rest of the\\nroom.  It was strange, but everything seemed to have its double in this\\ninvisible wall of clear water.  Yes, picture for picture was repeated,\\nand couch for couch.  The sleeping Faun that lay in the alcove by the\\ndoorway had its twin brother that slumbered, and the silver Venus that\\nstood in the sunlight held out her arms to a Venus as lovely as herself.\\n\\nWas it Echo?  He had called to her once in the valley, and she had\\nanswered him word for word.  Could she mock the eye, as she mocked the\\nvoice?  Could she make a mimic world just like the real world?  Could the\\nshadows of things have colour and life and movement?  Could it be that—?\\n\\nHe started, and taking from his breast the beautiful white rose, he\\nturned round, and kissed it.  The monster had a rose of its own, petal\\nfor petal the same!  It kissed it with like kisses, and pressed it to its\\nheart with horrible gestures.\\n\\nWhen the truth dawned upon him, he gave a wild cry of despair, and fell\\nsobbing to the ground.  So it was he who was misshapen and hunchbacked,\\nfoul to look at and grotesque.  He himself was the monster, and it was at\\nhim that all the children had been laughing, and the little Princess who\\nhe had thought loved him—she too had been merely mocking at his ugliness,\\nand making merry over his twisted limbs.  Why had they not left him in\\nthe forest, where there was no mirror to tell him how loathsome he was?\\nWhy had his father not killed him, rather than sell him to his shame?\\nThe hot tears poured down his cheeks, and he tore the white rose to\\npieces.  The sprawling monster did the same, and scattered the faint\\npetals in the air.  It grovelled on the ground, and, when he looked at\\nit, it watched him with a face drawn with pain.  He crept away, lest he\\nshould see it, and covered his eyes with his hands.  He crawled, like\\nsome wounded thing, into the shadow, and lay there moaning.\\n\\nAnd at that moment the Infanta herself came in with her companions\\nthrough the open window, and when they saw the ugly little dwarf lying on\\nthe ground and beating the floor with his clenched hands, in the most\\nfantastic and exaggerated manner, they went off into shouts of happy\\nlaughter, and stood all round him and watched him.\\n\\n‘His dancing was funny,’ said the Infanta; ‘but his acting is funnier\\nstill.  Indeed he is almost as good as the puppets, only of course not\\nquite so natural.’  And she fluttered her big fan, and applauded.\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf never looked up, and his sobs grew fainter and\\nfainter, and suddenly he gave a curious gasp, and clutched his side.  And\\nthen he fell back again, and lay quite still.\\n\\n‘That is capital,’ said the Infanta, after a pause; ‘but now you must\\ndance for me.’\\n\\n‘Yes,’ cried all the children, ‘you must get up and dance, for you are as\\nclever as the Barbary apes, and much more ridiculous.’  But the little\\nDwarf made no answer.\\n\\nAnd the Infanta stamped her foot, and called out to her uncle, who was\\nwalking on the terrace with the Chamberlain, reading some despatches that\\nhad just arrived from Mexico, where the Holy Office had recently been\\nestablished.  ‘My funny little dwarf is sulking,’ she cried, ‘you must\\nwake him up, and tell him to dance for me.’\\n\\nThey smiled at each other, and sauntered in, and Don Pedro stooped down,\\nand slapped the Dwarf on the cheek with his embroidered glove.  ‘You must\\ndance,’ he said, ‘_petit monsire_.  You must dance.  The Infanta of Spain\\nand the Indies wishes to be amused.’\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf never moved.\\n\\n‘A whipping master should be sent for,’ said Don Pedro wearily, and he\\nwent back to the terrace.  But the Chamberlain looked grave, and he knelt\\nbeside the little dwarf, and put his hand upon his heart.  And after a\\nfew moments he shrugged his shoulders, and rose up, and having made a low\\nbow to the Infanta, he said—\\n\\n‘_Mi bella Princesa_, your funny little dwarf will never dance again.  It\\nis a pity, for he is so ugly that he might have made the King smile.’\\n\\n‘But why will he not dance again?’ asked the Infanta, laughing.\\n\\n‘Because his heart is broken,’ answered the Chamberlain.\\n\\nAnd the Infanta frowned, and her dainty rose-leaf lips curled in pretty\\ndisdain.  ‘For the future let those who come to play with me have no\\nhearts,’ she cried, and she ran out into the garden.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE FISHERMAN AND HIS SOUL\\n\\n\\n                                TO H.S.H.\\n                             ALICE, PRINCESS\\n                                OF MONACO\\n\\nEVERY evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and threw his\\nnets into the water.\\n\\nWhen the wind blew from the land he caught nothing, or but little at\\nbest, for it was a bitter and black-winged wind, and rough waves rose up\\nto meet it.  But when the wind blew to the shore, the fish came in from\\nthe deep, and swam into the meshes of his nets, and he took them to the\\nmarket-place and sold them.\\n\\nEvery evening he went out upon the sea, and one evening the net was so\\nheavy that hardly could he draw it into the boat.  And he laughed, and\\nsaid to himself, ‘Surely I have caught all the fish that swim, or snared\\nsome dull monster that will be a marvel to men, or some thing of horror\\nthat the great Queen will desire,’ and putting forth all his strength, he\\ntugged at the coarse ropes till, like lines of blue enamel round a vase\\nof bronze, the long veins rose up on his arms.  He tugged at the thin\\nropes, and nearer and nearer came the circle of flat corks, and the net\\nrose at last to the top of the water.\\n\\nBut no fish at all was in it, nor any monster or thing of horror, but\\nonly a little Mermaid lying fast asleep.\\n\\nHer hair was as a wet fleece of gold, and each separate hair as a thread\\nof fine gold in a cup of glass.  Her body was as white ivory, and her\\ntail was of silver and pearl.  Silver and pearl was her tail, and the\\ngreen weeds of the sea coiled round it; and like sea-shells were her\\nears, and her lips were like sea-coral.  The cold waves dashed over her\\ncold breasts, and the salt glistened upon her eyelids.\\n\\nSo beautiful was she that when the young Fisherman saw her he was filled\\nwith wonder, and he put out his hand and drew the net close to him, and\\nleaning over the side he clasped her in his arms.  And when he touched\\nher, she gave a cry like a startled sea-gull, and woke, and looked at him\\nin terror with her mauve-amethyst eyes, and struggled that she might\\nescape.  But he held her tightly to him, and would not suffer her to\\ndepart.\\n\\nAnd when she saw that she could in no way escape from him, she began to\\nweep, and said, ‘I pray thee let me go, for I am the only daughter of a\\nKing, and my father is aged and alone.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered, ‘I will not let thee go save thou\\nmakest me a promise that whenever I call thee, thou wilt come and sing to\\nme, for the fish delight to listen to the song of the Sea-folk, and so\\nshall my nets be full.’\\n\\n‘Wilt thou in very truth let me go, if I promise thee this?’ cried the\\nMermaid.\\n\\n‘In very truth I will let thee go,’ said the young Fisherman.\\n\\nSo she made him the promise he desired, and sware it by the oath of the\\nSea-folk.  And he loosened his arms from about her, and she sank down\\ninto the water, trembling with a strange fear.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nEvery evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and called to\\nthe Mermaid, and she rose out of the water and sang to him.  Round and\\nround her swam the dolphins, and the wild gulls wheeled above her head.\\n\\nAnd she sang a marvellous song.  For she sang of the Sea-folk who drive\\ntheir flocks from cave to cave, and carry the little calves on their\\nshoulders; of the Tritons who have long green beards, and hairy breasts,\\nand blow through twisted conchs when the King passes by; of the palace of\\nthe King which is all of amber, with a roof of clear emerald, and a\\npavement of bright pearl; and of the gardens of the sea where the great\\nfiligrane fans of coral wave all day long, and the fish dart about like\\nsilver birds, and the anemones cling to the rocks, and the pinks bourgeon\\nin the ribbed yellow sand.  She sang of the big whales that come down\\nfrom the north seas and have sharp icicles hanging to their fins; of the\\nSirens who tell of such wonderful things that the merchants have to stop\\ntheir ears with wax lest they should hear them, and leap into the water\\nand be drowned; of the sunken galleys with their tall masts, and the\\nfrozen sailors clinging to the rigging, and the mackerel swimming in and\\nout of the open portholes; of the little barnacles who are great\\ntravellers, and cling to the keels of the ships and go round and round\\nthe world; and of the cuttlefish who live in the sides of the cliffs and\\nstretch out their long black arms, and can make night come when they will\\nit.  She sang of the nautilus who has a boat of her own that is carved\\nout of an opal and steered with a silken sail; of the happy Mermen who\\nplay upon harps and can charm the great Kraken to sleep; of the little\\nchildren who catch hold of the slippery porpoises and ride laughing upon\\ntheir backs; of the Mermaids who lie in the white foam and hold out their\\narms to the mariners; and of the sea-lions with their curved tusks, and\\nthe sea-horses with their floating manes.\\n\\nAnd as she sang, all the tunny-fish came in from the deep to listen to\\nher, and the young Fisherman threw his nets round them and caught them,\\nand others he took with a spear.  And when his boat was well-laden, the\\nMermaid would sink down into the sea, smiling at him.\\n\\nYet would she never come near him that he might touch her.  Oftentimes he\\ncalled to her and prayed of her, but she would not; and when he sought to\\nseize her she dived into the water as a seal might dive, nor did he see\\nher again that day.  And each day the sound of her voice became sweeter\\nto his ears.  So sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his\\ncunning, and had no care of his craft.  Vermilion-finned and with eyes of\\nbossy gold, the tunnies went by in shoals, but he heeded them not.  His\\nspear lay by his side unused, and his baskets of plaited osier were\\nempty.  With lips parted, and eyes dim with wonder, he sat idle in his\\nboat and listened, listening till the sea-mists crept round him, and the\\nwandering moon stained his brown limbs with silver.\\n\\nAnd one evening he called to her, and said: ‘Little Mermaid, little\\nMermaid, I love thee.  Take me for thy bridegroom, for I love thee.’\\n\\nBut the Mermaid shook her head.  ‘Thou hast a human soul,’ she answered.\\n‘If only thou wouldst send away thy soul, then could I love thee.’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman said to himself, ‘Of what use is my soul to me?\\nI cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.  Surely I will\\nsend it away from me, and much gladness shall be mine.’  And a cry of joy\\nbroke from his lips, and standing up in the painted boat, he held out his\\narms to the Mermaid.  ‘I will send my soul away,’ he cried, ‘and you\\nshall be my bride, and I will be thy bridegroom, and in the depth of the\\nsea we will dwell together, and all that thou hast sung of thou shalt\\nshow me, and all that thou desirest I will do, nor shall our lives be\\ndivided.’\\n\\nAnd the little Mermaid laughed for pleasure and hid her face in her\\nhands.\\n\\n‘But how shall I send my soul from me?’ cried the young Fisherman.  ‘Tell\\nme how I may do it, and lo! it shall be done.’\\n\\n‘Alas!  I know not,’ said the little Mermaid: ‘the Sea-folk have no\\nsouls.’  And she sank down into the deep, looking wistfully at him.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nNow early on the next morning, before the sun was the span of a man’s\\nhand above the hill, the young Fisherman went to the house of the Priest\\nand knocked three times at the door.\\n\\nThe novice looked out through the wicket, and when he saw who it was, he\\ndrew back the latch and said to him, ‘Enter.’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman passed in, and knelt down on the sweet-smelling\\nrushes of the floor, and cried to the Priest who was reading out of the\\nHoly Book and said to him, ‘Father, I am in love with one of the\\nSea-folk, and my soul hindereth me from having my desire.  Tell me how I\\ncan send my soul away from me, for in truth I have no need of it.  Of\\nwhat value is my soul to me?  I cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do\\nnot know it.’\\n\\nAnd the Priest beat his breast, and answered, ‘Alack, alack, thou art\\nmad, or hast eaten of some poisonous herb, for the soul is the noblest\\npart of man, and was given to us by God that we should nobly use it.\\nThere is no thing more precious than a human soul, nor any earthly thing\\nthat can be weighed with it.  It is worth all the gold that is in the\\nworld, and is more precious than the rubies of the kings.  Therefore, my\\nson, think not any more of this matter, for it is a sin that may not be\\nforgiven.  And as for the Sea-folk, they are lost, and they who would\\ntraffic with them are lost also.  They are as the beasts of the field\\nthat know not good from evil, and for them the Lord has not died.’\\n\\nThe young Fisherman’s eyes filled with tears when he heard the bitter\\nwords of the Priest, and he rose up from his knees and said to him,\\n‘Father, the Fauns live in the forest and are glad, and on the rocks sit\\nthe Mermen with their harps of red gold.  Let me be as they are, I\\nbeseech thee, for their days are as the days of flowers.  And as for my\\nsoul, what doth my soul profit me, if it stand between me and the thing\\nthat I love?’\\n\\n‘The love of the body is vile,’ cried the Priest, knitting his brows,\\n‘and vile and evil are the pagan things God suffers to wander through His\\nworld.  Accursed be the Fauns of the woodland, and accursed be the\\nsingers of the sea!  I have heard them at night-time, and they have\\nsought to lure me from my beads.  They tap at the window, and laugh.\\nThey whisper into my ears the tale of their perilous joys.  They tempt me\\nwith temptations, and when I would pray they make mouths at me.  They are\\nlost, I tell thee, they are lost.  For them there is no heaven nor hell,\\nand in neither shall they praise God’s name.’\\n\\n‘Father,’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘thou knowest not what thou sayest.\\nOnce in my net I snared the daughter of a King.  She is fairer than the\\nmorning star, and whiter than the moon.  For her body I would give my\\nsoul, and for her love I would surrender heaven.  Tell me what I ask of\\nthee, and let me go in peace.’\\n\\n‘Away!  Away!’ cried the Priest: ‘thy leman is lost, and thou shalt be\\nlost with her.’\\n\\nAnd he gave him no blessing, but drove him from his door.\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman went down into the market-place, and he walked\\nslowly, and with bowed head, as one who is in sorrow.\\n\\nAnd when the merchants saw him coming, they began to whisper to each\\nother, and one of them came forth to meet him, and called him by name,\\nand said to him, ‘What hast thou to sell?’\\n\\n‘I will sell thee my soul,’ he answered.  ‘I pray thee buy it of me, for\\nI am weary of it.  Of what use is my soul to me?  I cannot see it.  I may\\nnot touch it.  I do not know it.’\\n\\nBut the merchants mocked at him, and said, ‘Of what use is a man’s soul\\nto us?  It is not worth a clipped piece of silver.  Sell us thy body for\\na slave, and we will clothe thee in sea-purple, and put a ring upon thy\\nfinger, and make thee the minion of the great Queen.  But talk not of the\\nsoul, for to us it is nought, nor has it any value for our service.’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman said to himself: ‘How strange a thing this is!\\nThe Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world,\\nand the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.’\\nAnd he passed out of the market-place, and went down to the shore of the\\nsea, and began to ponder on what he should do.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd at noon he remembered how one of his companions, who was a gatherer\\nof samphire, had told him of a certain young Witch who dwelt in a cave at\\nthe head of the bay and was very cunning in her witcheries.  And he set\\nto and ran, so eager was he to get rid of his soul, and a cloud of dust\\nfollowed him as he sped round the sand of the shore.  By the itching of\\nher palm the young Witch knew his coming, and she laughed and let down\\nher red hair.  With her red hair falling around her, she stood at the\\nopening of the cave, and in her hand she had a spray of wild hemlock that\\nwas blossoming.\\n\\n‘What d’ye lack?  What d’ye lack?’ she cried, as he came panting up the\\nsteep, and bent down before her.  ‘Fish for thy net, when the wind is\\nfoul?  I have a little reed-pipe, and when I blow on it the mullet come\\nsailing into the bay.  But it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price.\\nWhat d’ye lack?  What d’ye lack?  A storm to wreck the ships, and wash\\nthe chests of rich treasure ashore?  I have more storms than the wind\\nhas, for I serve one who is stronger than the wind, and with a sieve and\\na pail of water I can send the great galleys to the bottom of the sea.\\nBut I have a price, pretty boy, I have a price.  What d’ye lack?  What\\nd’ye lack?  I know a flower that grows in the valley, none knows it but\\nI.  It has purple leaves, and a star in its heart, and its juice is as\\nwhite as milk.  Shouldst thou touch with this flower the hard lips of the\\nQueen, she would follow thee all over the world.  Out of the bed of the\\nKing she would rise, and over the whole world she would follow thee.  And\\nit has a price, pretty boy, it has a price.  What d’ye lack?  What d’ye\\nlack?  I can pound a toad in a mortar, and make broth of it, and stir the\\nbroth with a dead man’s hand.  Sprinkle it on thine enemy while he\\nsleeps, and he will turn into a black viper, and his own mother will slay\\nhim.  With a wheel I can draw the Moon from heaven, and in a crystal I\\ncan show thee Death.  What d’ye lack?  What d’ye lack?  Tell me thy\\ndesire, and I will give it thee, and thou shalt pay me a price, pretty\\nboy, thou shalt pay me a price.’\\n\\n‘My desire is but for a little thing,’ said the young Fisherman, ‘yet\\nhath the Priest been wroth with me, and driven me forth.  It is but for a\\nlittle thing, and the merchants have mocked at me, and denied me.\\nTherefore am I come to thee, though men call thee evil, and whatever be\\nthy price I shall pay it.’\\n\\n‘What wouldst thou?’ asked the Witch, coming near to him.\\n\\n‘I would send my soul away from me,’ answered the young Fisherman.\\n\\nThe Witch grew pale, and shuddered, and hid her face in her blue mantle.\\n‘Pretty boy, pretty boy,’ she muttered, ‘that is a terrible thing to do.’\\n\\nHe tossed his brown curls and laughed.  ‘My soul is nought to me,’ he\\nanswered.  ‘I cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.’\\n\\n‘What wilt thou give me if I tell thee?’ asked the Witch, looking down at\\nhim with her beautiful eyes.\\n\\n‘Five pieces of gold,’ he said, ‘and my nets, and the wattled house where\\nI live, and the painted boat in which I sail.  Only tell me how to get\\nrid of my soul, and I will give thee all that I possess.’\\n\\nShe laughed mockingly at him, and struck him with the spray of hemlock.\\n‘I can turn the autumn leaves into gold,’ she answered, ‘and I can weave\\nthe pale moonbeams into silver if I will it.  He whom I serve is richer\\nthan all the kings of this world, and has their dominions.’\\n\\n‘What then shall I give thee,’ he cried, ‘if thy price be neither gold\\nnor silver?’\\n\\nThe Witch stroked his hair with her thin white hand.  ‘Thou must dance\\nwith me, pretty boy,’ she murmured, and she smiled at him as she spoke.\\n\\n‘Nought but that?’ cried the young Fisherman in wonder and he rose to his\\nfeet.\\n\\n‘Nought but that,’ she answered, and she smiled at him again.\\n\\n‘Then at sunset in some secret place we shall dance together,’ he said,\\n‘and after that we have danced thou shalt tell me the thing which I\\ndesire to know.’\\n\\nShe shook her head.  ‘When the moon is full, when the moon is full,’ she\\nmuttered.  Then she peered all round, and listened.  A blue bird rose\\nscreaming from its nest and circled over the dunes, and three spotted\\nbirds rustled through the coarse grey grass and whistled to each other.\\nThere was no other sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth\\npebbles below.  So she reached out her hand, and drew him near to her and\\nput her dry lips close to his ear.\\n\\n‘To-night thou must come to the top of the mountain,’ she whispered.  ‘It\\nis a Sabbath, and He will be there.’\\n\\nThe young Fisherman started and looked at her, and she showed her white\\nteeth and laughed.  ‘Who is He of whom thou speakest?’ he asked.\\n\\n‘It matters not,’ she answered.  ‘Go thou to-night, and stand under the\\nbranches of the hornbeam, and wait for my coming.  If a black dog run\\ntowards thee, strike it with a rod of willow, and it will go away.  If an\\nowl speak to thee, make it no answer.  When the moon is full I shall be\\nwith thee, and we will dance together on the grass.’\\n\\n‘But wilt thou swear to me to tell me how I may send my soul from me?’ he\\nmade question.\\n\\nShe moved out into the sunlight, and through her red hair rippled the\\nwind.  ‘By the hoofs of the goat I swear it,’ she made answer.\\n\\n‘Thou art the best of the witches,’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘and I\\nwill surely dance with thee to-night on the top of the mountain.  I would\\nindeed that thou hadst asked of me either gold or silver.  But such as\\nthy price is thou shalt have it, for it is but a little thing.’  And he\\ndoffed his cap to her, and bent his head low, and ran back to the town\\nfilled with a great joy.\\n\\nAnd the Witch watched him as he went, and when he had passed from her\\nsight she entered her cave, and having taken a mirror from a box of\\ncarved cedarwood, she set it up on a frame, and burned vervain on lighted\\ncharcoal before it, and peered through the coils of the smoke.  And after\\na time she clenched her hands in anger.  ‘He should have been mine,’ she\\nmuttered, ‘I am as fair as she is.’\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman climbed up\\nto the top of the mountain, and stood under the branches of the hornbeam.\\nLike a targe of polished metal the round sea lay at his feet, and the\\nshadows of the fishing-boats moved in the little bay.  A great owl, with\\nyellow sulphurous eyes, called to him by his name, but he made it no\\nanswer.  A black dog ran towards him and snarled.  He struck it with a\\nrod of willow, and it went away whining.\\n\\nAt midnight the witches came flying through the air like bats.  ‘Phew!’\\nthey cried, as they lit upon the ground, ‘there is some one here we know\\nnot!’ and they sniffed about, and chattered to each other, and made\\nsigns.  Last of all came the young Witch, with her red hair streaming in\\nthe wind.  She wore a dress of gold tissue embroidered with peacocks’\\neyes, and a little cap of green velvet was on her head.\\n\\n‘Where is he, where is he?’ shrieked the witches when they saw her, but\\nshe only laughed, and ran to the hornbeam, and taking the Fisherman by\\nthe hand she led him out into the moonlight and began to dance.\\n\\nRound and round they whirled, and the young Witch jumped so high that he\\ncould see the scarlet heels of her shoes.  Then right across the dancers\\ncame the sound of the galloping of a horse, but no horse was to be seen,\\nand he felt afraid.\\n\\n‘Faster,’ cried the Witch, and she threw her arms about his neck, and her\\nbreath was hot upon his face.  ‘Faster, faster!’ she cried, and the earth\\nseemed to spin beneath his feet, and his brain grew troubled, and a great\\nterror fell on him, as of some evil thing that was watching him, and at\\nlast he became aware that under the shadow of a rock there was a figure\\nthat had not been there before.\\n\\nIt was a man dressed in a suit of black velvet, cut in the Spanish\\nfashion.  His face was strangely pale, but his lips were like a proud red\\nflower.  He seemed weary, and was leaning back toying in a listless\\nmanner with the pommel of his dagger.  On the grass beside him lay a\\nplumed hat, and a pair of riding-gloves gauntleted with gilt lace, and\\nsewn with seed-pearls wrought into a curious device.  A short cloak lined\\nwith sables hang from his shoulder, and his delicate white hands were\\ngemmed with rings.  Heavy eyelids drooped over his eyes.\\n\\nThe young Fisherman watched him, as one snared in a spell.  At last their\\neyes met, and wherever he danced it seemed to him that the eyes of the\\nman were upon him.  He heard the Witch laugh, and caught her by the\\nwaist, and whirled her madly round and round.\\n\\nSuddenly a dog bayed in the wood, and the dancers stopped, and going up\\ntwo by two, knelt down, and kissed the man’s hands.  As they did so, a\\nlittle smile touched his proud lips, as a bird’s wing touches the water\\nand makes it laugh.  But there was disdain in it.  He kept looking at the\\nyoung Fisherman.\\n\\n‘Come! let us worship,’ whispered the Witch, and she led him up, and a\\ngreat desire to do as she besought him seized on him, and he followed\\nher.  But when he came close, and without knowing why he did it, he made\\non his breast the sign of the Cross, and called upon the holy name.\\n\\nNo sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks and flew\\naway, and the pallid face that had been watching him twitched with a\\nspasm of pain.  The man went over to a little wood, and whistled.  A\\njennet with silver trappings came running to meet him.  As he leapt upon\\nthe saddle he turned round, and looked at the young Fisherman sadly.\\n\\nAnd the Witch with the red hair tried to fly away also, but the Fisherman\\ncaught her by her wrists, and held her fast.\\n\\n‘Loose me,’ she cried, ‘and let me go.  For thou hast named what should\\nnot be named, and shown the sign that may not be looked at.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ he answered, ‘but I will not let thee go till thou hast told me\\nthe secret.’\\n\\n‘What secret?’ said the Witch, wrestling with him like a wild cat, and\\nbiting her foam-flecked lips.\\n\\n‘Thou knowest,’ he made answer.\\n\\nHer grass-green eyes grew dim with tears, and she said to the Fisherman,\\n‘Ask me anything but that!’\\n\\nHe laughed, and held her all the more tightly.\\n\\nAnd when she saw that she could not free herself, she whispered to him,\\n‘Surely I am as fair as the daughters of the sea, and as comely as those\\nthat dwell in the blue waters,’ and she fawned on him and put her face\\nclose to his.\\n\\nBut he thrust her back frowning, and said to her, ‘If thou keepest not\\nthe promise that thou madest to me I will slay thee for a false witch.’\\n\\nShe grew grey as a blossom of the Judas tree, and shuddered.  ‘Be it so,’\\nshe muttered.  ‘It is thy soul and not mine.  Do with it as thou wilt.’\\nAnd she took from her girdle a little knife that had a handle of green\\nviper’s skin, and gave it to him.\\n\\n‘What shall this serve me?’ he asked of her, wondering.\\n\\nShe was silent for a few moments, and a look of terror came over her\\nface.  Then she brushed her hair back from her forehead, and smiling\\nstrangely she said to him, ‘What men call the shadow of the body is not\\nthe shadow of the body, but is the body of the soul.  Stand on the\\nsea-shore with thy back to the moon, and cut away from around thy feet\\nthy shadow, which is thy soul’s body, and bid thy soul leave thee, and it\\nwill do so.’\\n\\nThe young Fisherman trembled.  ‘Is this true?’ he murmured.\\n\\n‘It is true, and I would that I had not told thee of it,’ she cried, and\\nshe clung to his knees weeping.\\n\\nHe put her from him and left her in the rank grass, and going to the edge\\nof the mountain he placed the knife in his belt and began to climb down.\\n\\nAnd his Soul that was within him called out to him and said, ‘Lo!  I have\\ndwelt with thee for all these years, and have been thy servant.  Send me\\nnot away from thee now, for what evil have I done thee?’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman laughed.  ‘Thou hast done me no evil, but I have\\nno need of thee,’ he answered.  ‘The world is wide, and there is Heaven\\nalso, and Hell, and that dim twilight house that lies between.  Go\\nwherever thou wilt, but trouble me not, for my love is calling to me.’\\n\\nAnd his Soul besought him piteously, but he heeded it not, but leapt from\\ncrag to crag, being sure-footed as a wild goat, and at last he reached\\nthe level ground and the yellow shore of the sea.\\n\\nBronze-limbed and well-knit, like a statue wrought by a Grecian, he stood\\non the sand with his back to the moon, and out of the foam came white\\narms that beckoned to him, and out of the waves rose dim forms that did\\nhim homage.  Before him lay his shadow, which was the body of his soul,\\nand behind him hung the moon in the honey-coloured air.\\n\\nAnd his Soul said to him, ‘If indeed thou must drive me from thee, send\\nme not forth without a heart.  The world is cruel, give me thy heart to\\ntake with me.’\\n\\nHe tossed his head and smiled.  ‘With what should I love my love if I\\ngave thee my heart?’ he cried.\\n\\n‘Nay, but be merciful,’ said his Soul: ‘give me thy heart, for the world\\nis very cruel, and I am afraid.’\\n\\n‘My heart is my love’s,’ he answered, ‘therefore tarry not, but get thee\\ngone.’\\n\\n‘Should I not love also?’ asked his Soul.\\n\\n‘Get thee gone, for I have no need of thee,’ cried the young Fisherman,\\nand he took the little knife with its handle of green viper’s skin, and\\ncut away his shadow from around his feet, and it rose up and stood before\\nhim, and looked at him, and it was even as himself.\\n\\nHe crept back, and thrust the knife into his belt, and a feeling of awe\\ncame over him.  ‘Get thee gone,’ he murmured, ‘and let me see thy face no\\nmore.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but we must meet again,’ said the Soul.  Its voice was low and\\nflute-like, and its lips hardly moved while it spake.\\n\\n‘How shall we meet?’ cried the young Fisherman.  ‘Thou wilt not follow me\\ninto the depths of the sea?’\\n\\n‘Once every year I will come to this place, and call to thee,’ said the\\nSoul.  ‘It may be that thou wilt have need of me.’\\n\\n‘What need should I have of thee?’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘but be it\\nas thou wilt,’ and he plunged into the waters and the Tritons blew their\\nhorns and the little Mermaid rose up to meet him, and put her arms around\\nhis neck and kissed him on the mouth.\\n\\nAnd the Soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them.  And when they\\nhad sunk down into the sea, it went weeping away over the marshes.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd after a year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the sea and\\ncalled to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep, and said,\\n‘Why dost thou call to me?’\\n\\nAnd the Soul answered, ‘Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I\\nhave seen marvellous things.’\\n\\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head\\nupon his hand and listened.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd the Soul said to him, ‘When I left thee I turned my face to the East\\nand journeyed.  From the East cometh everything that is wise.  Six days I\\njourneyed, and on the morning of the seventh day I came to a hill that is\\nin the country of the Tartars.  I sat down under the shade of a tamarisk\\ntree to shelter myself from the sun.  The land was dry and burnt up with\\nthe heat.  The people went to and fro over the plain like flies crawling\\nupon a disk of polished copper.\\n\\n‘When it was noon a cloud of red dust rose up from the flat rim of the\\nland.  When the Tartars saw it, they strung their painted bows, and\\nhaving leapt upon their little horses they galloped to meet it.  The\\nwomen fled screaming to the waggons, and hid themselves behind the felt\\ncurtains.\\n\\n‘At twilight the Tartars returned, but five of them were missing, and of\\nthose that came back not a few had been wounded.  They harnessed their\\nhorses to the waggons and drove hastily away.  Three jackals came out of\\na cave and peered after them.  Then they sniffed up the air with their\\nnostrils, and trotted off in the opposite direction.\\n\\n‘When the moon rose I saw a camp-fire burning on the plain, and went\\ntowards it.  A company of merchants were seated round it on carpets.\\nTheir camels were picketed behind them, and the negroes who were their\\nservants were pitching tents of tanned skin upon the sand, and making a\\nhigh wall of the prickly pear.\\n\\n‘As I came near them, the chief of the merchants rose up and drew his\\nsword, and asked me my business.\\n\\n‘I answered that I was a Prince in my own land, and that I had escaped\\nfrom the Tartars, who had sought to make me their slave.  The chief\\nsmiled, and showed me five heads fixed upon long reeds of bamboo.\\n\\n‘Then he asked me who was the prophet of God, and I answered him\\nMohammed.\\n\\n‘When he heard the name of the false prophet, he bowed and took me by the\\nhand, and placed me by his side.  A negro brought me some mare’s milk in\\na wooden dish, and a piece of lamb’s flesh roasted.\\n\\n‘At daybreak we started on our journey.  I rode on a red-haired camel by\\nthe side of the chief, and a runner ran before us carrying a spear.  The\\nmen of war were on either hand, and the mules followed with the\\nmerchandise.  There were forty camels in the caravan, and the mules were\\ntwice forty in number.\\n\\n‘We went from the country of the Tartars into the country of those who\\ncurse the Moon.  We saw the Gryphons guarding their gold on the white\\nrocks, and the scaled Dragons sleeping in their caves.  As we passed over\\nthe mountains we held our breath lest the snows might fall on us, and\\neach man tied a veil of gauze before his eyes.  As we passed through the\\nvalleys the Pygmies shot arrows at us from the hollows of the trees, and\\nat night-time we heard the wild men beating on their drums.  When we came\\nto the Tower of Apes we set fruits before them, and they did not harm us.\\nWhen we came to the Tower of Serpents we gave them warm milk in howls of\\nbrass, and they let us go by.  Three times in our journey we came to the\\nbanks of the Oxus.  We crossed it on rafts of wood with great bladders of\\nblown hide.  The river-horses raged against us and sought to slay us.\\nWhen the camels saw them they trembled.\\n\\n‘The kings of each city levied tolls on us, but would not suffer us to\\nenter their gates.  They threw us bread over the walls, little\\nmaize-cakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates.\\nFor every hundred baskets we gave them a bead of amber.\\n\\n‘When the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned the wells\\nand fled to the hill-summits.  We fought with the Magadae who are born\\nold, and grow younger and younger every year, and die when they are\\nlittle children; and with the Laktroi who say that they are the sons of\\ntigers, and paint themselves yellow and black; and with the Aurantes who\\nbury their dead on the tops of trees, and themselves live in dark caverns\\nlest the Sun, who is their god, should slay them; and with the Krimnians\\nwho worship a crocodile, and give it earrings of green glass, and feed it\\nwith butter and fresh fowls; and with the Agazonbae, who are dog-faced;\\nand with the Sibans, who have horses’ feet, and run more swiftly than\\nhorses.  A third of our company died in battle, and a third died of want.\\nThe rest murmured against me, and said that I had brought them an evil\\nfortune.  I took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me.\\nWhen they saw that I did not sicken they grew afraid.\\n\\n‘In the fourth month we reached the city of Illel.  It was night-time\\nwhen we came to the grove that is outside the walls, and the air was\\nsultry, for the Moon was travelling in Scorpion.  We took the ripe\\npomegranates from the trees, and brake them, and drank their sweet\\njuices.  Then we lay down on our carpets, and waited for the dawn.\\n\\n‘And at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city.  It was wrought\\nout of red bronze, and carved with sea-dragons and dragons that have\\nwings.  The guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our\\nbusiness.  The interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from\\nthe island of Syria with much merchandise.  They took hostages, and told\\nus that they would open the gate to us at noon, and bade us tarry till\\nthen.\\n\\n‘When it was noon they opened the gate, and as we entered in the people\\ncame crowding out of the houses to look at us, and a crier went round the\\ncity crying through a shell.  We stood in the market-place, and the\\nnegroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests\\nof sycamore.  And when they had ended their task, the merchants set forth\\ntheir strange wares, the waxed linen from Egypt and the painted linen\\nfrom the country of the Ethiops, the purple sponges from Tyre and the\\nblue hangings from Sidon, the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of\\nglass and the curious vessels of burnt clay.  From the roof of a house a\\ncompany of women watched us.  One of them wore a mask of gilded leather.\\n\\n‘And on the first day the priests came and bartered with us, and on the\\nsecond day came the nobles, and on the third day came the craftsmen and\\nthe slaves.  And this is their custom with all merchants as long as they\\ntarry in the city.\\n\\n‘And we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I wearied and\\nwandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of\\nits god.  The priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the\\ngreen trees, and on a pavement of black marble stood the rose-red house\\nin which the god had his dwelling.  Its doors were of powdered lacquer,\\nand bulls and peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold.\\nThe tilted roof was of sea-green porcelain, and the jutting eaves were\\nfestooned with little bells.  When the white doves flew past, they struck\\nthe bells with their wings and made them tinkle.\\n\\n‘In front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx.\\nI lay down beside it, and with my pale fingers I touched the broad\\nleaves.  One of the priests came towards me and stood behind me.  He had\\nsandals on his feet, one of soft serpent-skin and the other of birds’\\nplumage.  On his head was a mitre of black felt decorated with silver\\ncrescents.  Seven yellows were woven into his robe, and his frizzed hair\\nwas stained with antimony.\\n\\n‘After a little while he spake to me, and asked me my desire.\\n\\n‘I told him that my desire was to see the god.\\n\\n‘“The god is hunting,” said the priest, looking strangely at me with his\\nsmall slanting eyes.\\n\\n‘“Tell me in what forest, and I will ride with him,” I answered.\\n\\n‘He combed out the soft fringes of his tunic with his long pointed nails.\\n“The god is asleep,” he murmured.\\n\\n‘“Tell me on what couch, and I will watch by him,” I answered.\\n\\n‘“The god is at the feast,” he cried.\\n\\n‘“If the wine be sweet I will drink it with him, and if it be bitter I\\nwill drink it with him also,” was my answer.\\n\\n‘He bowed his head in wonder, and, taking me by the hand, he raised me\\nup, and led me into the temple.\\n\\n‘And in the first chamber I saw an idol seated on a throne of jasper\\nbordered with great orient pearls.  It was carved out of ebony, and in\\nstature was of the stature of a man.  On its forehead was a ruby, and\\nthick oil dripped from its hair on to its thighs.  Its feet were red with\\nthe blood of a newly-slain kid, and its loins girt with a copper belt\\nthat was studded with seven beryls.\\n\\n‘And I said to the priest, “Is this the god?”  And he answered me, “This\\nis the god.”\\n\\n‘“Show me the god,” I cried, “or I will surely slay thee.”  And I touched\\nhis hand, and it became withered.\\n\\n‘And the priest besought me, saying, “Let my lord heal his servant, and I\\nwill show him the god.”\\n\\n‘So I breathed with my breath upon his hand, and it became whole again,\\nand he trembled and led me into the second chamber, and I saw an idol\\nstanding on a lotus of jade hung with great emeralds.  It was carved out\\nof ivory, and in stature was twice the stature of a man.  On its forehead\\nwas a chrysolite, and its breasts were smeared with myrrh and cinnamon.\\nIn one hand it held a crooked sceptre of jade, and in the other a round\\ncrystal.  It ware buskins of brass, and its thick neck was circled with a\\ncircle of selenites.\\n\\n‘And I said to the priest, “Is this the god?”\\n\\n‘And he answered me, “This is the god.”\\n\\n‘“Show me the god,” I cried, “or I will surely slay thee.”  And I touched\\nhis eyes, and they became blind.\\n\\n‘And the priest besought me, saying, “Let my lord heal his servant, and I\\nwill show him the god.”\\n\\n‘So I breathed with my breath upon his eyes, and the sight came back to\\nthem, and he trembled again, and led me into the third chamber, and lo!\\nthere was no idol in it, nor image of any kind, but only a mirror of\\nround metal set on an altar of stone.\\n\\n‘And I said to the priest, “Where is the god?”\\n\\n‘And he answered me: “There is no god but this mirror that thou seest,\\nfor this is the Mirror of Wisdom.  And it reflecteth all things that are\\nin heaven and on earth, save only the face of him who looketh into it.\\nThis it reflecteth not, so that he who looketh into it may be wise.  Many\\nother mirrors are there, but they are mirrors of Opinion.  This only is\\nthe Mirror of Wisdom.  And they who possess this mirror know everything,\\nnor is there anything hidden from them.  And they who possess it not have\\nnot Wisdom.  Therefore is it the god, and we worship it.”  And I looked\\ninto the mirror, and it was even as he had said to me.\\n\\n‘And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a valley\\nthat is but a day’s journey from this place have I hidden the Mirror of\\nWisdom.  Do but suffer me to enter into thee again and be thy servant,\\nand thou shalt be wiser than all the wise men, and Wisdom shall be thine.\\nSuffer me to enter into thee, and none will be as wise as thou.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman laughed.  ‘Love is better than Wisdom,’ he cried,\\n‘and the little Mermaid loves me.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but there is nothing better than Wisdom,’ said the Soul.\\n\\n‘Love is better,’ answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the\\ndeep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd after the second year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of\\nthe sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep\\nand said, ‘Why dost thou call to me?’\\n\\nAnd the Soul answered, ‘Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I\\nhave seen marvellous things.’\\n\\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head\\nupon his hand and listened.\\n\\nAnd the Soul said to him, ‘When I left thee, I turned my face to the\\nSouth and journeyed.  From the South cometh everything that is precious.\\nSix days I journeyed along the highways that lead to the city of Ashter,\\nalong the dusty red-dyed highways by which the pilgrims are wont to go\\ndid I journey, and on the morning of the seventh day I lifted up my eyes,\\nand lo! the city lay at my feet, for it is in a valley.\\n\\n‘There are nine gates to this city, and in front of each gate stands a\\nbronze horse that neighs when the Bedouins come down from the mountains.\\nThe walls are cased with copper, and the watch-towers on the walls are\\nroofed with brass.  In every tower stands an archer with a bow in his\\nhand.  At sunrise he strikes with an arrow on a gong, and at sunset he\\nblows through a horn of horn.\\n\\n‘When I sought to enter, the guards stopped me and asked of me who I was.\\nI made answer that I was a Dervish and on my way to the city of Mecca,\\nwhere there was a green veil on which the Koran was embroidered in silver\\nletters by the hands of the angels.  They were filled with wonder, and\\nentreated me to pass in.\\n\\n‘Inside it is even as a bazaar.  Surely thou shouldst have been with me.\\nAcross the narrow streets the gay lanterns of paper flutter like large\\nbutterflies.  When the wind blows over the roofs they rise and fall as\\npainted bubbles do.  In front of their booths sit the merchants on silken\\ncarpets.  They have straight black beards, and their turbans are covered\\nwith golden sequins, and long strings of amber and carved peach-stones\\nglide through their cool fingers.  Some of them sell galbanum and nard,\\nand curious perfumes from the islands of the Indian Sea, and the thick\\noil of red roses, and myrrh and little nail-shaped cloves.  When one\\nstops to speak to them, they throw pinches of frankincense upon a\\ncharcoal brazier and make the air sweet.  I saw a Syrian who held in his\\nhands a thin rod like a reed.  Grey threads of smoke came from it, and\\nits odour as it burned was as the odour of the pink almond in spring.\\nOthers sell silver bracelets embossed all over with creamy blue turquoise\\nstones, and anklets of brass wire fringed with little pearls, and tigers’\\nclaws set in gold, and the claws of that gilt cat, the leopard, set in\\ngold also, and earrings of pierced emerald, and finger-rings of hollowed\\njade.  From the tea-houses comes the sound of the guitar, and the\\nopium-smokers with their white smiling faces look out at the passers-by.\\n\\n‘Of a truth thou shouldst have been with me.  The wine-sellers elbow\\ntheir way through the crowd with great black skins on their shoulders.\\nMost of them sell the wine of Schiraz, which is as sweet as honey.  They\\nserve it in little metal cups and strew rose leaves upon it.  In the\\nmarket-place stand the fruitsellers, who sell all kinds of fruit: ripe\\nfigs, with their bruised purple flesh, melons, smelling of musk and\\nyellow as topazes, citrons and rose-apples and clusters of white grapes,\\nround red-gold oranges, and oval lemons of green gold.  Once I saw an\\nelephant go by.  Its trunk was painted with vermilion and turmeric, and\\nover its ears it had a net of crimson silk cord.  It stopped opposite one\\nof the booths and began eating the oranges, and the man only laughed.\\nThou canst not think how strange a people they are.  When they are glad\\nthey go to the bird-sellers and buy of them a caged bird, and set it free\\nthat their joy may be greater, and when they are sad they scourge\\nthemselves with thorns that their sorrow may not grow less.\\n\\n‘One evening I met some negroes carrying a heavy palanquin through the\\nbazaar.  It was made of gilded bamboo, and the poles were of vermilion\\nlacquer studded with brass peacocks.  Across the windows hung thin\\ncurtains of muslin embroidered with beetles’ wings and with tiny\\nseed-pearls, and as it passed by a pale-faced Circassian looked out and\\nsmiled at me.  I followed behind, and the negroes hurried their steps and\\nscowled.  But I did not care.  I felt a great curiosity come over me.\\n\\n‘At last they stopped at a square white house.  There were no windows to\\nit, only a little door like the door of a tomb.  They set down the\\npalanquin and knocked three times with a copper hammer.  An Armenian in a\\ncaftan of green leather peered through the wicket, and when he saw them\\nhe opened, and spread a carpet on the ground, and the woman stepped out.\\nAs she went in, she turned round and smiled at me again.  I had never\\nseen any one so pale.\\n\\n‘When the moon rose I returned to the same place and sought for the\\nhouse, but it was no longer there.  When I saw that, I knew who the woman\\nwas, and wherefore she had smiled at me.\\n\\n‘Certainly thou shouldst have been with me.  On the feast of the New Moon\\nthe young Emperor came forth from his palace and went into the mosque to\\npray.  His hair and beard were dyed with rose-leaves, and his cheeks were\\npowdered with a fine gold dust.  The palms of his feet and hands were\\nyellow with saffron.\\n\\n‘At sunrise he went forth from his palace in a robe of silver, and at\\nsunset he returned to it again in a robe of gold.  The people flung\\nthemselves on the ground and hid their faces, but I would not do so.  I\\nstood by the stall of a seller of dates and waited.  When the Emperor saw\\nme, he raised his painted eyebrows and stopped.  I stood quite still, and\\nmade him no obeisance.  The people marvelled at my boldness, and\\ncounselled me to flee from the city.  I paid no heed to them, but went\\nand sat with the sellers of strange gods, who by reason of their craft\\nare abominated.  When I told them what I had done, each of them gave me a\\ngod and prayed me to leave them.\\n\\n‘That night, as I lay on a cushion in the tea-house that is in the Street\\nof Pomegranates, the guards of the Emperor entered and led me to the\\npalace.  As I went in they closed each door behind me, and put a chain\\nacross it.  Inside was a great court with an arcade running all round.\\nThe walls were of white alabaster, set here and there with blue and green\\ntiles.  The pillars were of green marble, and the pavement of a kind of\\npeach-blossom marble.  I had never seen anything like it before.\\n\\n‘As I passed across the court two veiled women looked down from a balcony\\nand cursed me.  The guards hastened on, and the butts of the lances rang\\nupon the polished floor.  They opened a gate of wrought ivory, and I\\nfound myself in a watered garden of seven terraces.  It was planted with\\ntulip-cups and moonflowers, and silver-studded aloes.  Like a slim reed\\nof crystal a fountain hung in the dusky air.  The cypress-trees were like\\nburnt-out torches.  From one of them a nightingale was singing.\\n\\n‘At the end of the garden stood a little pavilion.  As we approached it\\ntwo eunuchs came out to meet us.  Their fat bodies swayed as they walked,\\nand they glanced curiously at me with their yellow-lidded eyes.  One of\\nthem drew aside the captain of the guard, and in a low voice whispered to\\nhim.  The other kept munching scented pastilles, which he took with an\\naffected gesture out of an oval box of lilac enamel.\\n\\n‘After a few moments the captain of the guard dismissed the soldiers.\\nThey went back to the palace, the eunuchs following slowly behind and\\nplucking the sweet mulberries from the trees as they passed.  Once the\\nelder of the two turned round, and smiled at me with an evil smile.\\n\\n‘Then the captain of the guard motioned me towards the entrance of the\\npavilion.  I walked on without trembling, and drawing the heavy curtain\\naside I entered in.\\n\\n‘The young Emperor was stretched on a couch of dyed lion skins, and a\\ngerfalcon perched upon his wrist.  Behind him stood a brass-turbaned\\nNubian, naked down to the waist, and with heavy earrings in his split\\nears.  On a table by the side of the couch lay a mighty scimitar of\\nsteel.\\n\\n‘When the Emperor saw me he frowned, and said to me, “What is thy name?\\nKnowest thou not that I am Emperor of this city?”  But I made him no\\nanswer.\\n\\n‘He pointed with his finger at the scimitar, and the Nubian seized it,\\nand rushing forward struck at me with great violence.  The blade whizzed\\nthrough me, and did me no hurt.  The man fell sprawling on the floor, and\\nwhen he rose up his teeth chattered with terror and he hid himself behind\\nthe couch.\\n\\n‘The Emperor leapt to his feet, and taking a lance from a stand of arms,\\nhe threw it at me.  I caught it in its flight, and brake the shaft into\\ntwo pieces.  He shot at me with an arrow, but I held up my hands and it\\nstopped in mid-air.  Then he drew a dagger from a belt of white leather,\\nand stabbed the Nubian in the throat lest the slave should tell of his\\ndishonour.  The man writhed like a trampled snake, and a red foam bubbled\\nfrom his lips.\\n\\n‘As soon as he was dead the Emperor turned to me, and when he had wiped\\naway the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled and\\npurple silk, he said to me, “Art thou a prophet, that I may not harm\\nthee, or the son of a prophet, that I can do thee no hurt?  I pray thee\\nleave my city to-night, for while thou art in it I am no longer its\\nlord.”\\n\\n‘And I answered him, “I will go for half of thy treasure.  Give me half\\nof thy treasure, and I will go away.”\\n\\n‘He took me by the hand, and led me out into the garden.  When the\\ncaptain of the guard saw me, he wondered.  When the eunuchs saw me, their\\nknees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear.\\n\\n‘There is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry,\\nand a brass-sealed ceiling hung with lamps.  The Emperor touched one of\\nthe walls and it opened, and we passed down a corridor that was lit with\\nmany torches.  In niches upon each side stood great wine-jars filled to\\nthe brim with silver pieces.  When we reached the centre of the corridor\\nthe Emperor spake the word that may not be spoken, and a granite door\\nswung back on a secret spring, and he put his hands before his face lest\\nhis eyes should be dazzled.\\n\\n‘Thou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was.  There were huge\\ntortoise-shells full of pearls, and hollowed moonstones of great size\\npiled up with red rubies.  The gold was stored in coffers of\\nelephant-hide, and the gold-dust in leather bottles.  There were opals\\nand sapphires, the former in cups of crystal, and the latter in cups of\\njade.  Round green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of\\nivory, and in one corner were silk bags filled, some with\\nturquoise-stones, and others with beryls.  The ivory horns were heaped\\nwith purple amethysts, and the horns of brass with chalcedonies and\\nsards.  The pillars, which were of cedar, were hung with strings of\\nyellow lynx-stones.  In the flat oval shields there were carbuncles, both\\nwine-coloured and coloured like grass.  And yet I have told thee but a\\ntithe of what was there.\\n\\n‘And when the Emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he\\nsaid to me: “This is my house of treasure, and half that is in it is\\nthine, even as I promised to thee.  And I will give thee camels and camel\\ndrivers, and they shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure\\nto whatever part of the world thou desirest to go.  And the thing shall\\nbe done to-night, for I would not that the Sun, who is my father, should\\nsee that there is in my city a man whom I cannot slay.”\\n\\n‘But I answered him, “The gold that is here is thine, and the silver also\\nis thine, and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price.  As\\nfor me, I have no need of these.  Nor shall I take aught from thee but\\nthat little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand.”\\n\\n‘And the Emperor frowned.  “It is but a ring of lead,” he cried, “nor has\\nit any value.  Therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my\\ncity.”\\n\\n‘“Nay,” I answered, “but I will take nought but that leaden ring, for I\\nknow what is written within it, and for what purpose.”\\n\\n‘And the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said, “Take all the\\ntreasure and go from my city.  The half that is mine shall be thine\\nalso.”\\n\\n‘And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a cave\\nthat is but a day’s journey from this place have, I hidden the Ring of\\nRiches.  It is but a day’s journey from this place, and it waits for thy\\ncoming.  He who has this Ring is richer than all the kings of the world.\\nCome therefore and take it, and the world’s riches shall be thine.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman laughed.  ‘Love is better than Riches,’ he cried,\\n‘and the little Mermaid loves me.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but there is nothing better than Riches,’ said the Soul.\\n\\n‘Love is better,’ answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the\\ndeep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd after the third year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of the\\nsea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep and\\nsaid, ‘Why dost thou call to me?’\\n\\nAnd the Soul answered, ‘Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I\\nhave seen marvellous things.’\\n\\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head\\nupon his hand and listened.\\n\\nAnd the Soul said to him, ‘In a city that I know of there is an inn that\\nstandeth by a river.  I sat there with sailors who drank of two\\ndifferent-coloured wines, and ate bread made of barley, and little salt\\nfish served in bay leaves with vinegar.  And as we sat and made merry,\\nthere entered to us an old man bearing a leathern carpet and a lute that\\nhad two horns of amber.  And when he had laid out the carpet on the\\nfloor, he struck with a quill on the wire strings of his lute, and a girl\\nwhose face was veiled ran in and began to dance before us.  Her face was\\nveiled with a veil of gauze, but her feet were naked.  Naked were her\\nfeet, and they moved over the carpet like little white pigeons.  Never\\nhave I seen anything so marvellous; and the city in which she dances is\\nbut a day’s journey from this place.’\\n\\nNow when the young Fisherman heard the words of his Soul, he remembered\\nthat the little Mermaid had no feet and could not dance.  And a great\\ndesire came over him, and he said to himself, ‘It is but a day’s journey,\\nand I can return to my love,’ and he laughed, and stood up in the shallow\\nwater, and strode towards the shore.\\n\\nAnd when he had reached the dry shore he laughed again, and held out his\\narms to his Soul.  And his Soul gave a great cry of joy and ran to meet\\nhim, and entered into him, and the young Fisherman saw stretched before\\nhim upon the sand that shadow of the body that is the body of the Soul.\\n\\nAnd his Soul said to him, ‘Let us not tarry, but get hence at once, for\\nthe Sea-gods are jealous, and have monsters that do their bidding.’\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nSo they made haste, and all that night they journeyed beneath the moon,\\nand all the next day they journeyed beneath the sun, and on the evening\\nof the day they came to a city.\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman said to his Soul, ‘Is this the city in which she\\ndances of whom thou didst speak to me?’\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‘It is not this city, but another.\\nNevertheless let us enter in.’  So they entered in and passed through the\\nstreets, and as they passed through the Street of the Jewellers the young\\nFisherman saw a fair silver cup set forth in a booth.  And his Soul said\\nto him, ‘Take that silver cup and hide it.’\\n\\nSo he took the cup and hid it in the fold of his tunic, and they went\\nhurriedly out of the city.\\n\\nAnd after that they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman\\nfrowned, and flung the cup away, and said to his Soul, ‘Why didst thou\\ntell me to take this cup and hide it, for it was an evil thing to do?’\\n\\nBut his Soul answered him, ‘Be at peace, be at peace.’\\n\\nAnd on the evening of the second day they came to a city, and the young\\nFisherman said to his Soul, ‘Is this the city in which she dances of whom\\nthou didst speak to me?’\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‘It is not this city, but another.\\nNevertheless let us enter in.’  So they entered in and passed through the\\nstreets, and as they passed through the Street of the Sellers of Sandals,\\nthe young Fisherman saw a child standing by a jar of water.  And his Soul\\nsaid to him, ‘Smite that child.’  So he smote the child till it wept, and\\nwhen he had done this they went hurriedly out of the city.\\n\\nAnd after that they had gone a league from the city the young Fisherman\\ngrew wroth, and said to his Soul, ‘Why didst thou tell me to smite the\\nchild, for it was an evil thing to do?’\\n\\nBut his Soul answered him, ‘Be at peace, be at peace.’\\n\\nAnd on the evening of the third day they came to a city, and the young\\nFisherman said to his Soul, ‘Is this the city in which she dances of whom\\nthou didst speak to me?’\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‘It may be that it is in this city, therefore\\nlet us enter in.’\\n\\nSo they entered in and passed through the streets, but nowhere could the\\nyoung Fisherman find the river or the inn that stood by its side.  And\\nthe people of the city looked curiously at him, and he grew afraid and\\nsaid to his Soul, ‘Let us go hence, for she who dances with white feet is\\nnot here.’\\n\\nBut his Soul answered, ‘Nay, but let us tarry, for the night is dark and\\nthere will be robbers on the way.’\\n\\nSo he sat him down in the market-place and rested, and after a time there\\nwent by a hooded merchant who had a cloak of cloth of Tartary, and bare a\\nlantern of pierced horn at the end of a jointed reed.  And the merchant\\nsaid to him, ‘Why dost thou sit in the market-place, seeing that the\\nbooths are closed and the bales corded?’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman answered him, ‘I can find no inn in this city,\\nnor have I any kinsman who might give me shelter.’\\n\\n‘Are we not all kinsmen?’ said the merchant.  ‘And did not one God make\\nus?  Therefore come with me, for I have a guest-chamber.’\\n\\nSo the young Fisherman rose up and followed the merchant to his house.\\nAnd when he had passed through a garden of pomegranates and entered into\\nthe house, the merchant brought him rose-water in a copper dish that he\\nmight wash his hands, and ripe melons that he might quench his thirst,\\nand set a bowl of rice and a piece of roasted kid before him.\\n\\nAnd after that he had finished, the merchant led him to the\\nguest-chamber, and bade him sleep and be at rest.  And the young\\nFisherman gave him thanks, and kissed the ring that was on his hand, and\\nflung himself down on the carpets of dyed goat’s-hair.  And when he had\\ncovered himself with a covering of black lamb’s-wool he fell asleep.\\n\\nAnd three hours before dawn, and while it was still night, his Soul waked\\nhim and said to him, ‘Rise up and go to the room of the merchant, even to\\nthe room in which he sleepeth, and slay him, and take from him his gold,\\nfor we have need of it.’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman rose up and crept towards the room of the\\nmerchant, and over the feet of the merchant there was lying a curved\\nsword, and the tray by the side of the merchant held nine purses of gold.\\nAnd he reached out his hand and touched the sword, and when he touched it\\nthe merchant started and awoke, and leaping up seized himself the sword\\nand cried to the young Fisherman, ‘Dost thou return evil for good, and\\npay with the shedding of blood for the kindness that I have shown thee?’\\n\\nAnd his Soul said to the young Fisherman, ‘Strike him,’ and he struck him\\nso that he swooned and he seized then the nine purses of gold, and fled\\nhastily through the garden of pomegranates, and set his face to the star\\nthat is the star of morning.\\n\\nAnd when they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman beat\\nhis breast, and said to his Soul, ‘Why didst thou bid me slay the\\nmerchant and take his gold?  Surely thou art evil.’\\n\\nBut his Soul answered him, ‘Be at peace, be at peace.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘I may not be at peace, for all that\\nthou hast made me to do I hate.  Thee also I hate, and I bid thee tell me\\nwherefore thou hast wrought with me in this wise.’\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‘When thou didst send me forth into the world\\nthou gavest me no heart, so I learned to do all these things and love\\nthem.’\\n\\n‘What sayest thou?’ murmured the young Fisherman.\\n\\n‘Thou knowest,’ answered his Soul, ‘thou knowest it well.  Hast thou\\nforgotten that thou gavest me no heart?  I trow not.  And so trouble not\\nthyself nor me, but be at peace, for there is no pain that thou shalt not\\ngive away, nor any pleasure that thou shalt not receive.’\\n\\nAnd when the young Fisherman heard these words he trembled and said to\\nhis Soul, ‘Nay, but thou art evil, and hast made me forget my love, and\\nhast tempted me with temptations, and hast set my feet in the ways of\\nsin.’\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‘Thou hast not forgotten that when thou didst\\nsend me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart.  Come, let us go to\\nanother city, and make merry, for we have nine purses of gold.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman took the nine purses of gold, and flung them\\ndown, and trampled on them.\\n\\n‘Nay,’ he cried, ‘but I will have nought to do with thee, nor will I\\njourney with thee anywhere, but even as I sent thee away before, so will\\nI send thee away now, for thou hast wrought me no good.’  And he turned\\nhis back to the moon, and with the little knife that had the handle of\\ngreen viper’s skin he strove to cut from his feet that shadow of the body\\nwhich is the body of the Soul.\\n\\nYet his Soul stirred not from him, nor paid heed to his command, but said\\nto him, ‘The spell that the Witch told thee avails thee no more, for I\\nmay not leave thee, nor mayest thou drive me forth.  Once in his life may\\na man send his Soul away, but he who receiveth back his Soul must keep it\\nwith him for ever, and this is his punishment and his reward.’\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman grew pale and clenched his hands and cried, ‘She\\nwas a false Witch in that she told me not that.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ answered his Soul, ‘but she was true to Him she worships, and\\nwhose servant she will be ever.’\\n\\nAnd when the young Fisherman knew that he could no longer get rid of his\\nSoul, and that it was an evil Soul and would abide with him always, he\\nfell upon the ground weeping bitterly.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd when it was day the young Fisherman rose up and said to his Soul, ‘I\\nwill bind my hands that I may not do thy bidding, and close my lips that\\nI may not speak thy words, and I will return to the place where she whom\\nI love has her dwelling.  Even to the sea will I return, and to the\\nlittle bay where she is wont to sing, and I will call to her and tell her\\nthe evil I have done and the evil thou hast wrought on me.’\\n\\nAnd his Soul tempted him and said, ‘Who is thy love, that thou shouldst\\nreturn to her?  The world has many fairer than she is.  There are the\\ndancing-girls of Samaris who dance in the manner of all kinds of birds\\nand beasts.  Their feet are painted with henna, and in their hands they\\nhave little copper bells.  They laugh while they dance, and their\\nlaughter is as clear as the laughter of water.  Come with me and I will\\nshow them to thee.  For what is this trouble of thine about the things of\\nsin?  Is that which is pleasant to eat not made for the eater?  Is there\\npoison in that which is sweet to drink?  Trouble not thyself, but come\\nwith me to another city.  There is a little city hard by in which there\\nis a garden of tulip-trees.  And there dwell in this comely garden white\\npeacocks and peacocks that have blue breasts.  Their tails when they\\nspread them to the sun are like disks of ivory and like gilt disks.  And\\nshe who feeds them dances for their pleasure, and sometimes she dances on\\nher hands and at other times she dances with her feet.  Her eyes are\\ncoloured with stibium, and her nostrils are shaped like the wings of a\\nswallow.  From a hook in one of her nostrils hangs a flower that is\\ncarved out of a pearl.  She laughs while she dances, and the silver rings\\nthat are about her ankles tinkle like bells of silver.  And so trouble\\nnot thyself any more, but come with me to this city.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but closed his lips with\\nthe seal of silence and with a tight cord bound his hands, and journeyed\\nback to the place from which he had come, even to the little bay where\\nhis love had been wont to sing.  And ever did his Soul tempt him by the\\nway, but he made it no answer, nor would he do any of the wickedness that\\nit sought to make him to do, so great was the power of the love that was\\nwithin him.\\n\\nAnd when he had reached the shore of the sea, he loosed the cord from his\\nhands, and took the seal of silence from his lips, and called to the\\nlittle Mermaid.  But she came not to his call, though he called to her\\nall day long and besought her.\\n\\nAnd his Soul mocked him and said, ‘Surely thou hast but little joy out of\\nthy love.  Thou art as one who in time of death pours water into a broken\\nvessel.  Thou givest away what thou hast, and nought is given to thee in\\nreturn.  It were better for thee to come with me, for I know where the\\nValley of Pleasure lies, and what things are wrought there.’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but in a cleft of the rock\\nhe built himself a house of wattles, and abode there for the space of a\\nyear.  And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he\\ncalled to her again, and at night-time he spake her name.  Yet never did\\nshe rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he\\nfind her though he sought for her in the caves and in the green water, in\\nthe pools of the tide and in the wells that are at the bottom of the\\ndeep.\\n\\nAnd ever did his Soul tempt him with evil, and whisper of terrible\\nthings.  Yet did it not prevail against him, so great was the power of\\nhis love.\\n\\nAnd after the year was over, the Soul thought within himself, ‘I have\\ntempted my master with evil, and his love is stronger than I am.  I will\\ntempt him now with good, and it may be that he will come with me.’\\n\\nSo he spake to the young Fisherman and said, ‘I have told thee of the joy\\nof the world, and thou hast turned a deaf ear to me.  Suffer me now to\\ntell thee of the world’s pain, and it may be that thou wilt hearken.  For\\nof a truth pain is the Lord of this world, nor is there any one who\\nescapes from its net.  There be some who lack raiment, and others who\\nlack bread.  There be widows who sit in purple, and widows who sit in\\nrags.  To and fro over the fens go the lepers, and they are cruel to each\\nother.  The beggars go up and down on the highways, and their wallets are\\nempty.  Through the streets of the cities walks Famine, and the Plague\\nsits at their gates.  Come, let us go forth and mend these things, and\\nmake them not to be.  Wherefore shouldst thou tarry here calling to thy\\nlove, seeing she comes not to thy call?  And what is love, that thou\\nshouldst set this high store upon it?’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered it nought, so great was the power of his\\nlove.  And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he\\ncalled to her again, and at night-time he spake her name.  Yet never did\\nshe rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he\\nfind her, though he sought for her in the rivers of the sea, and in the\\nvalleys that are under the waves, in the sea that the night makes purple,\\nand in the sea that the dawn leaves grey.\\n\\nAnd after the second year was over, the Soul said to the young Fisherman\\nat night-time, and as he sat in the wattled house alone, ‘Lo! now I have\\ntempted thee with evil, and I have tempted thee with good, and thy love\\nis stronger than I am.  Wherefore will I tempt thee no longer, but I pray\\nthee to suffer me to enter thy heart, that I may be one with thee even as\\nbefore.’\\n\\n‘Surely thou mayest enter,’ said the young Fisherman, ‘for in the days\\nwhen with no heart thou didst go through the world thou must have much\\nsuffered.’\\n\\n‘Alas!’ cried his Soul, ‘I can find no place of entrance, so compassed\\nabout with love is this heart of thine.’\\n\\n‘Yet I would that I could help thee,’ said the young Fisherman.\\n\\nAnd as he spake there came a great cry of mourning from the sea, even the\\ncry that men hear when one of the Sea-folk is dead.  And the young\\nFisherman leapt up, and left his wattled house, and ran down to the\\nshore.  And the black waves came hurrying to the shore, bearing with them\\na burden that was whiter than silver.  White as the surf it was, and like\\na flower it tossed on the waves.  And the surf took it from the waves,\\nand the foam took it from the surf, and the shore received it, and lying\\nat his feet the young Fisherman saw the body of the little Mermaid.  Dead\\nat his feet it was lying.\\n\\nWeeping as one smitten with pain he flung himself down beside it, and he\\nkissed the cold red of the mouth, and toyed with the wet amber of the\\nhair.  He flung himself down beside it on the sand, weeping as one\\ntrembling with joy, and in his brown arms he held it to his breast.  Cold\\nwere the lips, yet he kissed them.  Salt was the honey of the hair, yet\\nhe tasted it with a bitter joy.  He kissed the closed eyelids, and the\\nwild spray that lay upon their cups was less salt than his tears.\\n\\nAnd to the dead thing he made confession.  Into the shells of its ears he\\npoured the harsh wine of his tale.  He put the little hands round his\\nneck, and with his fingers he touched the thin reed of the throat.\\nBitter, bitter was his joy, and full of strange gladness was his pain.\\n\\nThe black sea came nearer, and the white foam moaned like a leper.  With\\nwhite claws of foam the sea grabbled at the shore.  From the palace of\\nthe Sea-King came the cry of mourning again, and far out upon the sea the\\ngreat Tritons blew hoarsely upon their horns.\\n\\n‘Flee away,’ said his Soul, ‘for ever doth the sea come nigher, and if\\nthou tarriest it will slay thee.  Flee away, for I am afraid, seeing that\\nthy heart is closed against me by reason of the greatness of thy love.\\nFlee away to a place of safety.  Surely thou wilt not send me without a\\nheart into another world?’\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman listened not to his Soul, but called on the\\nlittle Mermaid and said, ‘Love is better than wisdom, and more precious\\nthan riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men.  The fires\\ncannot destroy it, nor can the waters quench it.  I called on thee at\\ndawn, and thou didst not come to my call.  The moon heard thy name, yet\\nhadst thou no heed of me.  For evilly had I left thee, and to my own hurt\\nhad I wandered away.  Yet ever did thy love abide with me, and ever was\\nit strong, nor did aught prevail against it, though I have looked upon\\nevil and looked upon good.  And now that thou art dead, surely I will die\\nwith thee also.’\\n\\nAnd his Soul besought him to depart, but he would not, so great was his\\nlove.  And the sea came nearer, and sought to cover him with its waves,\\nand when he knew that the end was at hand he kissed with mad lips the\\ncold lips of the Mermaid, and the heart that was within him brake.  And\\nas through the fulness of his love his heart did break, the Soul found an\\nentrance and entered in, and was one with him even as before.  And the\\nsea covered the young Fisherman with its waves.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd in the morning the Priest went forth to bless the sea, for it had\\nbeen troubled.  And with him went the monks and the musicians, and the\\ncandle-bearers, and the swingers of censers, and a great company.\\n\\nAnd when the Priest reached the shore he saw the young Fisherman lying\\ndrowned in the surf, and clasped in his arms was the body of the little\\nMermaid.  And he drew back frowning, and having made the sign of the\\ncross, he cried aloud and said, ‘I will not bless the sea nor anything\\nthat is in it.  Accursed be the Sea-folk, and accursed be all they who\\ntraffic with them.  And as for him who for love’s sake forsook God, and\\nso lieth here with his leman slain by God’s judgment, take up his body\\nand the body of his leman, and bury them in the corner of the Field of\\nthe Fullers, and set no mark above them, nor sign of any kind, that none\\nmay know the place of their resting.  For accursed were they in their\\nlives, and accursed shall they be in their deaths also.’\\n\\nAnd the people did as he commanded them, and in the corner of the Field\\nof the Fullers, where no sweet herbs grew, they dug a deep pit, and laid\\nthe dead things within it.\\n\\nAnd when the third year was over, and on a day that was a holy day, the\\nPriest went up to the chapel, that he might show to the people the wounds\\nof the Lord, and speak to them about the wrath of God.\\n\\nAnd when he had robed himself with his robes, and entered in and bowed\\nhimself before the altar, he saw that the altar was covered with strange\\nflowers that never had been seen before.  Strange were they to look at,\\nand of curious beauty, and their beauty troubled him, and their odour was\\nsweet in his nostrils.  And he felt glad, and understood not why he was\\nglad.\\n\\nAnd after that he had opened the tabernacle, and incensed the monstrance\\nthat was in it, and shown the fair wafer to the people, and hid it again\\nbehind the veil of veils, he began to speak to the people, desiring to\\nspeak to them of the wrath of God.  But the beauty of the white flowers\\ntroubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils, and there came\\nanother word into his lips, and he spake not of the wrath of God, but of\\nthe God whose name is Love.  And why he so spake, he knew not.\\n\\nAnd when he had finished his word the people wept, and the Priest went\\nback to the sacristy, and his eyes were full of tears.  And the deacons\\ncame in and began to unrobe him, and took from him the alb and the\\ngirdle, the maniple and the stole.  And he stood as one in a dream.\\n\\nAnd after that they had unrobed him, he looked at them and said, ‘What\\nare the flowers that stand on the altar, and whence do they come?’\\n\\nAnd they answered him, ‘What flowers they are we cannot tell, but they\\ncome from the corner of the Fullers’ Field.’  And the Priest trembled,\\nand returned to his own house and prayed.\\n\\nAnd in the morning, while it was still dawn, he went forth with the monks\\nand the musicians, and the candle-bearers and the swingers of censers,\\nand a great company, and came to the shore of the sea, and blessed the\\nsea, and all the wild things that are in it.  The Fauns also he blessed,\\nand the little things that dance in the woodland, and the bright-eyed\\nthings that peer through the leaves.  All the things in God’s world he\\nblessed, and the people were filled with joy and wonder.  Yet never again\\nin the corner of the Fullers’ Field grew flowers of any kind, but the\\nfield remained barren even as before.  Nor came the Sea-folk into the bay\\nas they had been wont to do, for they went to another part of the sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE STAR-CHILD\\n\\n\\n                                    TO\\n                           MISS MARGOT TENNANT\\n                              [MRS. ASQUITH]\\n\\nONCE upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through\\na great pine-forest.  It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.  The\\nsnow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the\\nfrost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they\\npassed: and when they came to the Mountain-Torrent she was hanging\\nmotionless in air, for the Ice-King had kissed her.\\n\\nSo cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to\\nmake of it.\\n\\n‘Ugh!’ snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail\\nbetween his legs, ‘this is perfectly monstrous weather.  Why doesn’t the\\nGovernment look to it?’\\n\\n‘Weet! weet! weet!’ twittered the green Linnets, ‘the old Earth is dead\\nand they have laid her out in her white shroud.’\\n\\n‘The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,’\\nwhispered the Turtle-doves to each other.  Their little pink feet were\\nquite frost-bitten, but they felt that it was their duty to take a\\nromantic view of the situation.\\n\\n‘Nonsense!’ growled the Wolf.  ‘I tell you that it is all the fault of\\nthe Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.’  The Wolf\\nhad a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good\\nargument.\\n\\n‘Well, for my own part,’ said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher,\\n‘I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.  If a thing is so, it is\\nso, and at present it is terribly cold.’\\n\\nTerribly cold it certainly was.  The little Squirrels, who lived inside\\nthe tall fir-tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves\\nwarm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not\\nventure even to look out of doors.  The only people who seemed to enjoy\\nit were the great horned Owls.  Their feathers were quite stiff with\\nrime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and\\ncalled out to each other across the forest, ‘Tu-whit!  Tu-whoo!  Tu-whit!\\nTu-whoo! what delightful weather we are having!’\\n\\nOn and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers,\\nand stamping with their huge iron-shod boots upon the caked snow.  Once\\nthey sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when\\nthe stones are grinding; and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice\\nwhere the marsh-water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their\\nbundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again; and\\nonce they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized\\non them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her\\narms.  But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches\\nover all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at\\nlast they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the\\nvalley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.\\n\\nSo overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and\\nthe Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a\\nflower of gold.\\n\\nYet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered\\ntheir poverty, and one of them said to the other, ‘Why did we make merry,\\nseeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?  Better\\nthat we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had\\nfallen upon us and slain us.’\\n\\n‘Truly,’ answered his companion, ‘much is given to some, and little is\\ngiven to others.  Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there\\nequal division of aught save of sorrow.’\\n\\nBut as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing\\nhappened.  There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star.  It\\nslipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its\\ncourse, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink\\nbehind a clump of willow-trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no\\nmore than a stone’s-throw away.\\n\\n‘Why! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,’ they cried, and\\nthey set to and ran, so eager were they for the gold.\\n\\nAnd one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced\\nhis way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo!\\nthere was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.  So he hastened\\ntowards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a\\ncloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many\\nfolds.  And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure\\nthat had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat\\nthem down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they\\nmight divide the pieces of gold.  But, alas! no gold was in it, nor\\nsilver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who\\nwas asleep.\\n\\nAnd one of them said to the other: ‘This is a bitter ending to our hope,\\nnor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man?  Let\\nus leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have\\nchildren of our own whose bread we may not give to another.’\\n\\nBut his companion answered him: ‘Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave\\nthe child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou\\nart, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I\\nbring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.’\\n\\nSo very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to\\nshield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the\\nvillage, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of\\nheart.\\n\\nAnd when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, ‘Thou hast\\nthe child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should\\nshare.’\\n\\nBut he answered him: ‘Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but\\nthe child’s only,’ and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house\\nand knocked.\\n\\nAnd when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned\\nsafe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took\\nfrom his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots,\\nand bade him come in.\\n\\nBut he said to her, ‘I have found something in the forest, and I have\\nbrought it to thee to have care of it,’ and he stirred not from the\\nthreshold.\\n\\n‘What is it?’ she cried.  ‘Show it to me, for the house is bare, and we\\nhave need of many things.’  And he drew the cloak back, and showed her\\nthe sleeping child.\\n\\n‘Alack, goodman!’ she murmured, ‘have we not children of our own, that\\nthou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth?  And who knows\\nif it will not bring us bad fortune?  And how shall we tend it?’  And she\\nwas wroth against him.\\n\\n‘Nay, but it is a Star-Child,’ he answered; and he told her the strange\\nmanner of the finding of it.\\n\\nBut she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and\\ncried: ‘Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?\\nWho is there who careth for us?  And who giveth us food?’\\n\\n‘Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,’ he\\nanswered.\\n\\n‘Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?’ she asked.  ‘And is it\\nnot winter now?’\\n\\nAnd the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold.\\n\\nAnd a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made\\nher tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: ‘Wilt thou not close the\\ndoor?  There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.’\\n\\n‘Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter\\nwind?’ he asked.  And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to\\nthe fire.\\n\\nAnd after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were\\nfull of tears.  And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms,\\nand she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of\\ntheir own children was lying.  And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the\\ncurious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of\\namber that was round the child’s neck his wife took and set it in the\\nchest also.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nSo the Star-Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and\\nsat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.  And every year\\nhe became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the\\nvillage were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and\\nblack-haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were\\nlike the rings of the daffodil.  His lips, also, were like the petals of\\na red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water,\\nand his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.\\n\\nYet did his beauty work him evil.  For he grew proud, and cruel, and\\nselfish.  The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the\\nvillage, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he\\nwas noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over\\nthem, and called them his servants.  No pity had he for the poor, or for\\nthose who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast\\nstones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg\\ntheir bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that\\nvillage to ask for alms.  Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and\\nwould mock at the weakly and ill-favoured, and make jest of them; and\\nhimself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie\\nby the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his\\nown face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.\\n\\nOften did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: ‘We did not\\ndeal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have\\nnone to succour them.  Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?’\\n\\nOften did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of\\nliving things, saying to him: ‘The fly is thy brother.  Do it no harm.\\nThe wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.  Snare\\nthem not for thy pleasure.  God made the blind-worm and the mole, and\\neach has its place.  Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?  Even\\nthe cattle of the field praise Him.’\\n\\nBut the Star-Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and\\ngo back to his companions, and lead them.  And his companions followed\\nhim, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and\\nmake music.  And wherever the Star-Child led them they followed, and\\nwhatever the Star-Child bade them do, that did they.  And when he pierced\\nwith a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he\\ncast stones at the leper they laughed also.  And in all things he ruled\\nthem, and they became hard of heart even as he was.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nNow there passed one day through the village a poor beggar-woman.  Her\\ngarments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough\\nroad on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.  And\\nbeing weary she sat her down under a chestnut-tree to rest.\\n\\nBut when the Star-Child saw her, he said to his companions, ‘See!  There\\nsitteth a foul beggar-woman under that fair and green-leaved tree.  Come,\\nlet us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill-favoured.’\\n\\nSo he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked\\nat him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.  And\\nwhen the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what\\nthe Star-Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him:\\n‘Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has\\nthis poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the\\nground, and said, ‘Who art thou to question me what I do?  I am no son of\\nthine to do thy bidding.’\\n\\n‘Thou speakest truly,’ answered the Woodcutter, ‘yet did I show thee pity\\nwhen I found thee in the forest.’\\n\\nAnd when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a\\nswoon.  And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had\\ncare of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had\\nfallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.\\n\\nBut she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter, ‘Didst\\nthou not say that the child was found in the forest?  And was it not ten\\nyears from this day?’\\n\\nAnd the Woodcutter answered, ‘Yea, it was in the forest that I found him,\\nand it is ten years from this day.’\\n\\n‘And what signs didst thou find with him?’ she cried.  ‘Bare he not upon\\nhis neck a chain of amber?  Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue\\nbroidered with stars?’\\n\\n‘Truly,’ answered the Woodcutter, ‘it was even as thou sayest.’  And he\\ntook the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and\\nshowed them to her.\\n\\nAnd when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, ‘He is my little son\\nwhom I lost in the forest.  I pray thee send for him quickly, for in\\nsearch of him have I wandered over the whole world.’\\n\\nSo the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star-Child, and\\nsaid to him, ‘Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother,\\nwho is waiting for thee.’\\n\\nSo he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.  But when he saw her\\nwho was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, ‘Why, where is my\\nmother?  For I see none here but this vile beggar-woman.’\\n\\nAnd the woman answered him, ‘I am thy mother.’\\n\\n‘Thou art mad to say so,’ cried the Star-Child angrily.  ‘I am no son of\\nthine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.  Therefore get thee\\nhence, and let me see thy foul face no more.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,’ she\\ncried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.  ‘The\\nrobbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,’ she murmured, ‘but I\\nrecognised thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised,\\nthe cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain.  Therefore I pray thee\\ncome with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.\\nCome with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.’\\n\\nBut the Star-Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his\\nheart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the\\nwoman weeping for pain.\\n\\nAnd at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.  ‘If in\\nvery truth thou art my mother,’ he said, ‘it had been better hadst thou\\nstayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I\\nthought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou\\ntellest me that I am.  Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no\\nmore.’\\n\\n‘Alas! my son,’ she cried, ‘wilt thou not kiss me before I go?  For I\\nhave suffered much to find thee.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ said the Star-Child, ‘but thou art too foul to look at, and rather\\nwould I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.’\\n\\nSo the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and\\nwhen the Star-Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to\\nhis playmates that he might play with them.\\n\\nBut when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, ‘Why, thou art\\nas foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder.  Get thee hence, for\\nwe will not suffer thee to play with us,’ and they drave him out of the\\ngarden.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child frowned and said to himself, ‘What is this that they\\nsay to me?  I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall\\ntell me of my beauty.’\\n\\nSo he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was\\nas the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.  And he\\nflung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, ‘Surely\\nthis has come upon me by reason of my sin.  For I have denied my mother,\\nand driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.  Wherefore I will\\ngo and seek her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have\\nfound her.’\\n\\nAnd there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put\\nher hand upon his shoulder and said, ‘What doth it matter if thou hast\\nlost thy comeliness?  Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.’\\n\\nAnd he said to her, ‘Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a\\npunishment has this evil been sent to me.  Wherefore I must go hence, and\\nwander through the world till I find her, and she give me her\\nforgiveness.’\\n\\nSo he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to\\nhim, but there was no answer.  All day long he called to her, and, when\\nthe sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves, and the birds and\\nthe animals fled from him, for they remembered his cruelty, and he was\\nalone save for the toad that watched him, and the slow adder that crawled\\npast.\\n\\nAnd in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the\\ntrees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping\\nsorely.  And of everything that he met he made inquiry if perchance they\\nhad seen his mother.\\n\\nHe said to the Mole, ‘Thou canst go beneath the earth.  Tell me, is my\\nmother there?’\\n\\nAnd the Mole answered, ‘Thou hast blinded mine eyes.  How should I know?’\\n\\nHe said to the Linnet, ‘Thou canst fly over the tops of the tall trees,\\nand canst see the whole world.  Tell me, canst thou see my mother?’\\n\\nAnd the Linnet answered, ‘Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.  How\\nshould I fly?’\\n\\nAnd to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir-tree, and was lonely, he\\nsaid, ‘Where is my mother?’\\n\\nAnd the Squirrel answered, ‘Thou hast slain mine.  Dost thou seek to slay\\nthine also?’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed forgiveness of\\nGod’s things, and went on through the forest, seeking for the\\nbeggar-woman.  And on the third day he came to the other side of the\\nforest and went down into the plain.\\n\\nAnd when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and\\nthrew stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep\\nin the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was\\nhe to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who\\nhad pity on him.  Nor could he hear anywhere of the beggar-woman who was\\nhis mother, though for the space of three years he wandered over the\\nworld, and often seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would\\ncall to her, and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to\\nbleed.  But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by the way did\\never deny that they had seen her, or any like to her, and they made sport\\nof his sorrow.\\n\\nFor the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world\\nthere was neither love nor loving-kindness nor charity for him, but it\\nwas even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great\\npride.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd one evening he came to the gate of a strong-walled city that stood by\\na river, and, weary and footsore though he was, he made to enter in.  But\\nthe soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the\\nentrance, and said roughly to him, ‘What is thy business in the city?’\\n\\n‘I am seeking for my mother,’ he answered, ‘and I pray ye to suffer me to\\npass, for it may be that she is in this city.’\\n\\nBut they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set\\ndown his shield and cried, ‘Of a truth, thy mother will not be merry when\\nshe sees thee, for thou art more ill-favoured than the toad of the marsh,\\nor the adder that crawls in the fen.  Get thee gone.  Get thee gone.  Thy\\nmother dwells not in this city.’\\n\\nAnd another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him, ‘Who is\\nthy mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?’\\n\\nAnd he answered, ‘My mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have treated\\nher evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her\\nforgiveness, if it be that she tarrieth in this city.’  But they would\\nnot, and pricked him with their spears.\\n\\nAnd, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt\\nflowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and\\nmade inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.  And\\nthey said to him, ‘It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have\\ndriven him away.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ he cried, laughing, ‘but we will sell the foul thing for a slave,\\nand his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.’\\n\\nAnd an old and evil-visaged man who was passing by called out, and said,\\n‘I will buy him for that price,’ and, when he had paid the price, he took\\nthe Star-Child by the hand and led him into the city.\\n\\nAnd after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little\\ndoor that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree.\\nAnd the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it\\nopened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with\\nblack poppies and green jars of burnt clay.  And the old man took then\\nfrom his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of\\nthe Star-Child, and drave him in front of him.  And when the scarf was\\ntaken off his eyes, the Star-Child found himself in a dungeon, that was\\nlit by a lantern of horn.\\n\\nAnd the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said,\\n‘Eat,’ and some brackish water in a cup and said, ‘Drink,’ and when he\\nhad eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him\\nand fastening it with an iron chain.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd on the morrow the old man, who was indeed the subtlest of the\\nmagicians of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the\\ntombs of the Nile, came in to him and frowned at him, and said, ‘In a\\nwood that is nigh to the gate of this city of Giaours there are three\\npieces of gold.  One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and\\nthe gold of the third one is red.  To-day thou shalt bring me the piece\\nof white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a\\nhundred stripes.  Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting\\nfor thee at the door of the garden.  See that thou bringest the white\\ngold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have\\nbought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.’  And he bound the\\neyes of the Star-Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him\\nthrough the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five\\nsteps of brass.  And having opened the little door with his ring he set\\nhim in the street.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child went out of the gate of the city, and came to the wood\\nof which the Magician had spoken to him.\\n\\nNow this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of\\nsinging birds and of sweet-scented flowers, and the Star-Child entered it\\ngladly.  Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh\\nbriars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil\\nnettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that\\nhe was in sore distress.  Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white\\ngold of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn\\nto noon, and from noon to sunset.  And at sunset he set his face towards\\nhome, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.\\n\\nBut when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a\\nthicket a cry as of some one in pain.  And forgetting his own sorrow he\\nran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that\\nsome hunter had set for it.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, ‘I am\\nmyself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.’\\n\\nAnd the Hare answered him, and said: ‘Surely thou hast given me freedom,\\nand what shall I give thee in return?’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child said to it, ‘I am seeking for a piece of white gold,\\nnor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will\\nbeat me.’\\n\\n‘Come thou with me,’ said the Hare, ‘and I will lead thee to it, for I\\nknow where it is hidden, and for what purpose.’\\n\\nSo the Star-Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great\\noak-tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.  And he was\\nfilled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, ‘The service that I\\ndid to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the\\nkindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred-fold.’\\n\\n‘Nay,’ answered the Hare, ‘but as thou dealt with me, so I did deal with\\nthee,’ and it ran away swiftly, and the Star-Child went towards the city.\\n\\nNow at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.  Over\\nhis face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes\\ngleamed like red coals.  And when he saw the Star-Child coming, he struck\\nupon a wooden bowl, and clattered his bell, and called out to him, and\\nsaid, ‘Give me a piece of money, or I must die of hunger.  For they have\\nthrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.’\\n\\n‘Alas!’ cried the Star-Child, ‘I have but one piece of money in my\\nwallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his\\nslave.’\\n\\nBut the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star-Child had\\npity, and gave him the piece of white gold.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and\\nbrought him in, and said to him, ‘Hast thou the piece of white gold?’\\nAnd the Star-Child answered, ‘I have it not.’  So the Magician fell upon\\nhim, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, ‘Eat,’\\nand an empty cup, and said, ‘Drink,’ and flung him again into the\\ndungeon.\\n\\nAnd on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, ‘If to-day thou\\nbringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my\\nslave, and give thee three hundred stripes.’\\n\\nSo the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the\\npiece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.  And at sunset he sat\\nhim down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the\\nlittle Hare that he had rescued from the trap.\\n\\nAnd the Hare said to him, ‘Why art thou weeping?  And what dost thou seek\\nin the wood?’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child answered, ‘I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold\\nthat is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and\\nkeep me as a slave.’\\n\\n‘Follow me,’ cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to\\na pool of water.  And at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold\\nwas lying.\\n\\n‘How shall I thank thee?’ said the Star-Child, ‘for lo! this is the\\nsecond time that you have succoured me.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,’ said the Hare, and it ran away\\nswiftly.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his\\nwallet, and hurried to the city.  But the leper saw him coming, and ran\\nto meet him, and knelt down and cried, ‘Give me a piece of money or I\\nshall die of hunger.’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child said to him, ‘I have in my wallet but one piece of\\nyellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep\\nme as his slave.’\\n\\nBut the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star-Child had pity on him,\\nand gave him the piece of yellow gold.\\n\\nAnd when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and\\nbrought him in, and said to him, ‘Hast thou the piece of yellow gold?’\\nAnd the Star-Child said to him, ‘I have it not.’  So the Magician fell\\nupon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again\\ninto the dungeon.\\n\\nAnd on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, ‘If to-day thou\\nbringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou\\nbringest it not I will surely slay thee.’\\n\\nSo the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the\\npiece of red gold, but nowhere could he find it.  And at evening he sat\\nhim down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little\\nHare.\\n\\nAnd the Hare said to him, ‘The piece of red gold that thou seekest is in\\nthe cavern that is behind thee.  Therefore weep no more but be glad.’\\n\\n‘How shall I reward thee?’ cried the Star-Child, ‘for lo! this is the\\nthird time thou hast succoured me.’\\n\\n‘Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,’ said the Hare, and it ran away\\nswiftly.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he\\nfound the piece of red gold.  So he put it in his wallet, and hurried to\\nthe city.  And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the\\nroad, and cried out, and said to him, ‘Give me the piece of red money, or\\nI must die,’ and the Star-Child had pity on him again, and gave him the\\npiece of red gold, saying, ‘Thy need is greater than mine.’  Yet was his\\nheart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nBut lo! as he passed through the gate of the city, the guards bowed down\\nand made obeisance to him, saying, ‘How beautiful is our lord!’ and a\\ncrowd of citizens followed him, and cried out, ‘Surely there is none so\\nbeautiful in the whole world!’ so that the Star-Child wept, and said to\\nhimself, ‘They are mocking me, and making light of my misery.’  And so\\nlarge was the concourse of the people, that he lost the threads of his\\nway, and found himself at last in a great square, in which there was a\\npalace of a King.\\n\\nAnd the gate of the palace opened, and the priests and the high officers\\nof the city ran forth to meet him, and they abased themselves before him,\\nand said, ‘Thou art our lord for whom we have been waiting, and the son\\nof our King.’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child answered them and said, ‘I am no king’s son, but the\\nchild of a poor beggar-woman.  And how say ye that I am beautiful, for I\\nknow that I am evil to look at?’\\n\\nThen he, whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet\\ncrouched a lion that had wings, held up a shield, and cried, ‘How saith\\nmy lord that he is not beautiful?’\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child looked, and lo! his face was even as it had been, and\\nhis comeliness had come back to him, and he saw that in his eyes which he\\nhad not seen there before.\\n\\nAnd the priests and the high officers knelt down and said to him, ‘It was\\nprophesied of old that on this day should come he who was to rule over\\nus.  Therefore, let our lord take this crown and this sceptre, and be in\\nhis justice and mercy our King over us.’\\n\\nBut he said to them, ‘I am not worthy, for I have denied the mother who\\nbare me, nor may I rest till I have found her, and known her forgiveness.\\nTherefore, let me go, for I must wander again over the world, and may not\\ntarry here, though ye bring me the crown and the sceptre.’  And as he\\nspake he turned his face from them towards the street that led to the\\ngate of the city, and lo! amongst the crowd that pressed round the\\nsoldiers, he saw the beggar-woman who was his mother, and at her side\\nstood the leper, who had sat by the road.\\n\\nAnd a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he ran over, and kneeling down\\nhe kissed the wounds on his mother’s feet, and wet them with his tears.\\nHe bowed his head in the dust, and sobbing, as one whose heart might\\nbreak, he said to her: ‘Mother, I denied thee in the hour of my pride.\\nAccept me in the hour of my humility.  Mother, I gave thee hatred.  Do\\nthou give me love.  Mother, I rejected thee.  Receive thy child now.’\\nBut the beggar-woman answered him not a word.\\n\\nAnd he reached out his hands, and clasped the white feet of the leper,\\nand said to him: ‘Thrice did I give thee of my mercy.  Bid my mother\\nspeak to me once.’  But the leper answered him not a word.\\n\\nAnd he sobbed again and said: ‘Mother, my suffering is greater than I can\\nbear.  Give me thy forgiveness, and let me go back to the forest.’  And\\nthe beggar-woman put her hand on his head, and said to him, ‘Rise,’ and\\nthe leper put his hand on his head, and said to him, ‘Rise,’ also.\\n\\nAnd he rose up from his feet, and looked at them, and lo! they were a\\nKing and a Queen.\\n\\nAnd the Queen said to him, ‘This is thy father whom thou hast succoured.’\\n\\nAnd the King said, ‘This is thy mother whose feet thou hast washed with\\nthy tears.’  And they fell on his neck and kissed him, and brought him\\ninto the palace and clothed him in fair raiment, and set the crown upon\\nhis head, and the sceptre in his hand, and over the city that stood by\\nthe river he ruled, and was its lord.  Much justice and mercy did he show\\nto all, and the evil Magician he banished, and to the Woodcutter and his\\nwife he sent many rich gifts, and to their children he gave high honour.\\nNor would he suffer any to be cruel to bird or beast, but taught love and\\nloving-kindness and charity, and to the poor he gave bread, and to the\\nnaked he gave raiment, and there was peace and plenty in the land.\\n\\nYet ruled he not long, so great had been his suffering, and so bitter the\\nfire of his testing, for after the space of three years he died.  And he\\nwho came after him ruled evilly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A HOUSE OF POMEGRANATES***\\n\\n\\n******* This file should be named 873-0.txt or 873-0.zip *******\\n\\n\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/8/7/873\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"

I believe this is the first English country house you\\nhave stayed at, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?\\n\\nHESTER.  We have not many.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady\\nCaroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as\\nbig as France and England put together.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.\\n[_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of\\nmy always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more\\ncharming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively\\ndamp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a\\nlittle lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane\\nmixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high\\ndistinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of\\nParliament, Mr. Kettle—\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his\\nname before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a\\nman, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.\\n\\nHESTER.  I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like\\nyourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are\\ninvited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord\\nBrancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she\\nwas married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t\\nbelieve she ran away more than once.\\n\\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady\\nHunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to\\nhave taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is\\nright in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,\\none never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not\\nconsidered the thing.\\n\\nHESTER.  In America those are the people we respect most.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I have no doubt of it.\\n\\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so\\nsincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come\\nacross.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young\\nlady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.\\nEnglish women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They\\nshow them then.\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young\\nman and a young girl?\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a\\ncushion_.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying\\nwhat a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful\\npower of selection.  It is quite a gift.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit\\nin very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will\\ncarry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.  [_To\\nFootman_.]  The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland.\\nGet the Shetland.  [_Exit Footman for shawl_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord\\nIllingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.  It\\nmeans a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear mother will be\\ndelighted.  I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.\\nDo you think she would, Gerald?  I know how difficult it is to get her to\\ngo anywhere.\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord\\nIllingworth had made me such an offer.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman with shawl_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come\\nup and meet him.  [_To Footman_.]  Just wait, Francis.  [_Writes\\nletter_.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as\\nyou are, Mr. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show\\nmyself worthy of it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I trust so.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ HESTER.]  _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss\\nWorsley.\\n\\nHESTER.  Are you very pleased about it?\\n\\nGERALD.  Of course I am.  It means everything to me—things that were out\\nof the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.\\n\\nHESTER.  Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.  Life is a hope.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord\\nIllingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that\\nmay not be true.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I don’t think that England should be represented abroad\\nby an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you are too\\nnervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I was in hopes he\\nwould have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he said her family was too\\nlarge.  Or was it her feet?  I forget which.  I regret it very much.  She\\nwas made to be an ambassador’s wife.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering\\npeople’s names, and forgetting their faces.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?  [_To\\nFootman_.]  Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a line to\\nyour dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she\\nreally must come to dinner.\\n\\n[_Exit Footman_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.  [_To_ HESTER.]\\nWill you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  With pleasure.  [_Exit with_ GERALD.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s good\\nfortune.  He is quite a _protégé_ of mine.  And I am particularly pleased\\nthat Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord\\nwithout my suggesting anything.  Nobody likes to be asked favours.  I\\nremember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season,\\nbecause she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to me.\\nIt was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking to be in\\nany respectable household.  I don’t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to\\nget rid of her.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that explains it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, the grass is too damp for you.  You had better go\\nand put on your overshoes at once.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You must allow me to be the best judge of that, John.\\nPray do as I tell you.\\n\\n[SIR JOHN _gets up and goes off_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!\\n\\n[_Enter_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\n[_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  Well, dear, I hope you like the park.  It is said\\nto be well timbered.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Quite, quite wonderful.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country\\nfor six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take\\nthe slightest notice of me.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I assure you, dear, that the country has not that\\neffect at all.  Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from\\nhere, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.  I remember the\\noccurrence perfectly.  Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of\\njoy, or gout.  I forget which.  We had a large party staying here at the\\ntime, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I think to elope is cowardly.  It’s running away from\\ndanger.  And danger has become so rare in modern life.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can make out, the young women of the present\\nday seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing\\nwith fire.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is\\nthat one never gets even singed.  It is the people who don’t know how to\\nplay with it who get burned up.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t know how the world would get on with such a\\ntheory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Ah!  The world was made for men and not for women.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Stutfield.  We have a much better\\ntime than they have.  There are far more things forbidden to us than are\\nforbidden to them.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; that is quite, quite true.  I had not thought of\\nthat.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?\\n\\nKELVIL.  I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.  It has\\nbeen an arduous task.  The demands on the time of a public man are very\\nheavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.  And I don’t think they meet with\\nadequate recognition.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, have you got your overshoes on?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Yes, my love.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think you had better come over here, John.  It is more\\nsheltered.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  You had better sit beside me.  [SIR\\nJOHN _rises and goes across_.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been writing about this morning, Mr.\\nKelvil?\\n\\nKELVIL.  On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield.  On Purity.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That must be such a very, very interesting thing to\\nwrite about.\\n\\nKELVIL.  It is the one subject of really national importance, nowadays,\\nLady Stutfield.  I purpose addressing my constituents on the question\\nbefore Parliament meets.  I find that the poorer classes of this country\\ndisplay a marked desire for a higher ethical standard.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How quite, quite nice of them.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Are you in favour of women taking part in politics, Mr.\\nKettle?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in\\nour political life, Lady Caroline.  Women are always on the side of\\nmorality, public and private.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It is so very, very gratifying to hear you say that.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes!—the moral qualities in women—that is the\\nimportant thing.  I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord Illingworth\\ndoesn’t value the moral qualities in women as much as he should.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, very\\nwicked.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  But what world says that, Lady Stutfield?  It must be\\nthe next world.  This world and I are on excellent terms.  [_Sits down\\nbeside_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Every one _I_ know says you are very, very wicked.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about,\\nnowadays, saying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely\\nand entirely true.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless, Lady\\nStutfield.  I have given up trying to reform him.  It would take a Public\\nCompany with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that.  But\\nyou have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth, haven’t you?  Gerald\\nArbuthnot has told us of his good fortune; it is really most kind of you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Hunstanton.  Kind is a\\ndreadful word.  I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I met\\nhim, and he’ll be of considerable use to me in something I am foolish\\nenough to think of doing.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  He is an admirable young man.  And his mother is one of\\nmy dearest friends.  He has just gone for a walk with our pretty\\nAmerican.  She is very pretty, is she not?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Far too pretty.  These American girls carry off all the\\ngood matches.  Why can’t they stay in their own country?  They are always\\ntelling us it is the Paradise of women.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is, Lady Caroline.  That is why, like Eve, they are\\nso extremely anxious to get out of it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Who are Miss Worsley’s parents?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American women are wonderfully clever in concealing\\ntheir parents.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean?  Miss\\nWorsley, Caroline, is an orphan.  Her father was a very wealthy\\nmillionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained my son\\nquite hospitably, when he visited Boston.  I don’t know how he made his\\nmoney, originally.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I fancy in American dry goods.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are American dry goods?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American novels.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How very singular! . . . Well, from whatever source her\\nlarge fortune came, I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley.  She dresses\\nexceedingly well.  All Americans do dress well.  They get their clothes\\nin Paris.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans die\\nthey go to Paris.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Indeed?  And when bad Americans die, where do they go\\nto?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, they go to America.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am afraid you don’t appreciate America, Lord Illingworth.  It\\nis a very remarkable country, especially considering its youth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The youth of America is their oldest tradition.  It\\nhas been going on now for three hundred years.  To hear them talk one\\nwould imagine they were in their first childhood.  As far as civilisation\\ngoes they are in their second.\\n\\nKELVIL.  There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in American\\npolitics.  I suppose you allude to that?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I wonder.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.  They\\ncertainly are in England.  Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country.  I\\nwonder Mrs. Cardew allows him.  I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don’t\\nthink that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I think they are the only people who should.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Do you take no side then in modern politics, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil.\\nTaking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows\\nshortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore.  However, the\\nHouse of Commons really does very little harm.  You can’t make people\\ngood by Act of Parliament,—that is something.\\n\\nKELVIL.  You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown great\\nsympathy with the sufferings of the poor.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is its special vice.  That is the special vice of\\nthe age.  One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of\\nlife.  The less said about life’s sores the better, Mr. Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Still our East End is a very important problem.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  It is the problem of slavery.  And we are\\ntrying to solve it by amusing the slaves.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, a great deal may be done by means of cheap\\nentertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth.  Dear Dr. Daubeny, our\\nrector here, provides, with the assistance of his curates, really\\nadmirable recreations for the poor during the winter.  And much good may\\nbe done by means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some popular\\namusement of that kind.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not at all in favour of amusements for the poor,\\nJane.  Blankets and coals are sufficient.  There is too much love of\\npleasure amongst the upper classes as it is.  Health is what we want in\\nmodern life.  The tone is not healthy, not healthy at all.\\n\\nKELVIL.  You are quite right, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I believe I am usually right.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Horrid word ‘health.’\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Silliest word in our language, and one knows so well\\nthe popular idea of health.  The English country gentleman galloping\\nafter a fox—the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.\\n\\nKELVIL.  May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House of Lords as\\na better institution than the House of Commons?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A much better institution, of course.  We in the House\\nof Lords are never in touch with public opinion.  That makes us a\\ncivilised body.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Are you serious in putting forward such a view?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\nVulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after one has\\ngiven them an idea, whether one is serious or not.  Nothing is serious\\nexcept passion.  The intellect is not a serious thing, and never has\\nbeen.  It is an instrument on which one plays, that is all.  The only\\nserious form of intellect I know is the British intellect.  And on the\\nBritish intellect the illiterates play the drum.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are you saying, Lord Illingworth, about the drum?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about the leading\\narticles in the London newspapers.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you believe all that is written in the\\nnewspapers?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do.  Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs.\\n[_Rises with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Are you going, Mrs. Allonby?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Just as far as the conservatory.  Lord Illingworth told me\\nthis morning that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven\\ndeadly sins.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind.  I will\\ncertainly speak to the gardener.\\n\\n[_Exit_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She lets her clever tongue run away with her sometimes.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows to run\\naway with her?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope so, Caroline, I am sure.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nDear Lord Alfred, do join us.  [LORD ALFRED _sits down beside_ LADY\\nSTUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You believe good of every one, Jane.  It is a great\\nfault.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, that one\\nshould believe evil of every one?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think it is much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield.\\nUntil, of course, people are found out to be good.  But that requires a\\ngreat deal of investigation nowadays.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But there is so much unkind scandal in modern life.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner that\\nthe basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant man, but he\\nseems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and purity\\nof life which is so important in this century.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, quite, quite important, is it not?\\n\\nKELVIL.  He gives me the impression of a man who does not appreciate the\\nbeauty of our English home-life.  I would say that he was tainted with\\nforeign ideas on the subject.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of home-life,\\nis there?\\n\\nKELVIL.  It is the mainstay of our moral system in England, Lady\\nStutfield.  Without it we would become like our neighbours.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That would be so, so sad, would it not?\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards woman simply as\\na toy.  Now, I have never regarded woman as a toy.  Woman is the\\nintellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life.  Without her\\nwe should forget the true ideals.  [_Sits down beside_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I am so very, very glad to hear you say that.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You a married man, Mr. Kettle?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, dear, Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am married, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Family?\\n\\nKELVIL.  Yes.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  How many?\\n\\nKELVIL.  Eight.\\n\\n[LADY STUTFIELD _turns her attention to_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at the\\nseaside?  [SIR JOHN _shrugs his shoulders_.]\\n\\nKELVIL.  My wife is at the seaside with the children, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You will join them later on, no doubt?\\n\\nKELVIL.  If my public engagements permit me.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Your public life must be a great source of gratification\\nto Mrs. Kettle.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_To_ LORD ALFRED.]  How very, very charming those\\ngold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord Alfred.\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  They are awfully expensive.  I can only afford them when\\nI’m in debt.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be in debt.\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  One must have some occupation nowadays.  If I hadn’t my\\ndebts I shouldn’t have anything to think about.  All the chaps I know are\\nin debt.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But don’t the people to whom you owe the money give you\\na great, great deal of annoyance?\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  Oh, no, they write; I don’t.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very strange.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs.\\nArbuthnot.  She won’t dine.  I am so sorry.  But she will come in the\\nevening.  I am very pleased indeed.  She is one of the sweetest of women.\\nWrites a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm.  [_Hands letter to_ LADY\\nCAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Looking at it_.]  A little lacking in femininity, Jane.\\nFemininity is the quality I admire most in women.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Taking back letter and leaving it on table_.]  Oh!\\nshe is very feminine, Caroline, and so good too.  You should hear what\\nthe Archdeacon says of her.  He regards her as his right hand in the\\nparish.  [_Footman speaks to her_.]  In the Yellow Drawing-room.  Shall\\nwe all go in?  Lady Stutfield, shall we go in to tea?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton.  [_They rise and proceed\\nto go off_.  SIR JOHN offers to carry LADY STUTFIELD’S cloak.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!  If you would allow your nephew to look after Lady\\nStutfield’s cloak, you might help me with my workbasket.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Certainly, my love.  [_Exeunt_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Curious thing, plain women are always jealous of their\\nhusbands, beautiful women never are!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Beautiful women never have time.  They are always so\\noccupied in being jealous of other people’s husbands.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should have thought Lady Caroline would have grown tired\\nof conjugal anxiety by this time!  Sir John is her fourth!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So much marriage is certainly not becoming.  Twenty\\nyears of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of\\nmarriage make her something like a public building.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Twenty years of romance!  Is there such a thing?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Not in our day.  Women have become too brilliant.\\nNothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Or the want of it in the man.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are quite right.  In a Temple every one should be\\nserious, except the thing that is worshipped.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And that should be man?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Women kneel so gracefully; men don’t.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for\\nthe last quarter of an hour.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Is she such a mystery?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is more than a mystery—she is a mood.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Moods don’t last.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is their chief charm.\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me, Lady\\nHunstanton and Lady Caroline, and . . . every one.  I hope I shall make a\\ngood secretary.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald.  [_Talks to\\nhim_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You enjoy country life, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  Very much indeed.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Don’t find yourself longing for a London dinner-party?\\n\\nHESTER.  I dislike London dinner-parties.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I adore them.  The clever people never listen, and the\\nstupid people never talk.\\n\\nHESTER.  I think the stupid people talk a great deal.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, I never listen!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy, if I didn’t like you I wouldn’t have made\\nyou the offer.  It is because I like you so much that I want to have you\\nwith me.\\n\\n[_Exit_ HESTER _with_ GERALD.]\\n\\nCharming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He is very nice; very nice indeed.  But I can’t stand the\\nAmerican young lady.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud voice too, that\\nshe was only eighteen.  It was most annoying.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never trust a woman who tells one her real\\nage.  A woman who would tell one that, would tell one anything.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She is a Puritan besides—\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah, that is inexcusable.  I don’t mind plain women\\nbeing Puritans.  It is the only excuse they have for being plain.  But\\nshe is decidedly pretty.  I admire her immensely.  [_Looks steadfastly\\nat_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a thoroughly bad man you must be!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you call a bad man?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The sort of man who admires innocence.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And a bad woman?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are severe—on yourself.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Define us as a sex.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Sphinxes without secrets.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Does that include the Puritan women?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do you know, I don’t believe in the existence of\\nPuritan women?  I don’t think there is a woman in the world who would not\\nbe a little flattered if one made love to her.  It is that which makes\\nwomen so irresistibly adorable.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You think there is no woman in the world who would object\\nto being kissed?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Very few.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you sure?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Quite.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you think she’d do if I kissed her?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her\\nglove.  What would you do if she struck you across the face with her\\nglove?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Fall in love with her, probably.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Is that a challenge?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is an arrow shot into the air.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t you know that I always succeed in whatever I\\ntry?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I am sorry to hear it.  We women adore failures.  They\\nlean on us.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You worship successes.  You cling to them.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We are the laurels to hide their baldness.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And they need you always, except at the moment of\\ntriumph.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They are uninteresting then.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How tantalising you are!  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like\\nyou for.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only one thing?  And I have so many bad qualities.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, don’t be too conceited about them.  You may lose them\\nas you grow old.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I never intend to grow old.  The soul is born old but\\ngrows young.  That is the comedy of life.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And the body is born young and grows old.  That is life’s\\ntragedy.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Its comedy also, sometimes.  But what is the\\nmysterious reason why you will always like me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is that you have never made love to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have never done anything else.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Really?  I have not noticed it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How fortunate!  It might have been a tragedy for both\\nof us.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We should each have survived.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One can survive everything nowadays, except death, and\\nlive down anything except a good reputation.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Have you tried a good reputation?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of the many annoyances to which I have never\\nbeen subjected.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It may come.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why do you threaten me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nFRANCIS.  Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Tell her ladyship we are coming in.\\n\\nFRANCIS.  Yes, my lord.\\n\\n[_Exit_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Shall we go in to tea?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you like such simple pleasures?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I adore simple pleasures.  They are the last refuge of\\nthe complex.  But, if you wish, let us stay here.  Yes, let us stay here.\\nThe Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It ends with Revelations.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You fence divinely.  But the button has come of your\\nfoil.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I have still the mask.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It makes your eyes lovelier.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Thank you.  Come.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT’S _letter on table_, _and takes\\nit up and looks at envelope_.]  What a curious handwriting!  It reminds\\nme of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Who?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! no one.  No one in particular.  A woman of no\\nimportance.  [_Throws letter down_, _and passes up the steps of the\\nterrace with_ MRS. ALLONBY.  _They smile at each other_.]\\n\\n                                ACT DROP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSECOND ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.\\n                               _Door_ R.C.\\n\\n[_Ladies seated on sofas_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a\\nlittle!\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly\\nhappy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to\\nleave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing\\nspace after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be\\nabsolutely worn to shadows.\\n\\n[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up\\nto the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to\\nescape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their\\npower and use it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense\\nall this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper\\nplace.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re\\nnot married?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a\\nwife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going\\nabout society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry\\nwithin twelve months.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they’re in love with some\\none who, perhaps, is tied to another?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off\\nin a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to\\nmeddle with other people’s property.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other\\npeople’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the\\nonly true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we\\ndon’t belong to any one.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you really think, dear Caroline, that\\nlegislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,\\nall the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like\\nmarried men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I certainly never know one from the other.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man\\nhas home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad\\nexpression in the eyes of so many married men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly\\ntedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they\\nare not.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely\\nchanged since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor dear\\nHunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I’m tired of\\nmeeting him.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you renew him from time to time, don’t you?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh no, Lady Caroline.  I have only had one husband as yet.\\nI suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  With your views on life I wonder you married at all.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  So do I.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, I believe you are really very happy in\\nyour married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from others.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, I hope not, dear.  I knew his mother quite well.\\nShe was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland’s daughters.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Victoria Stratton?  I remember her perfectly.  A silly\\nfair-haired woman with no chin.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, Ernest has a chin.  He has a very strong chin, a\\nsquare chin.  Ernest’s chin is far too square.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But do you really think a man’s chin can be too square?\\nI think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be\\nquite, quite square.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield.  It\\nis only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I adore silent men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Ernest isn’t silent.  He talks the whole time.  But he\\nhas got no conversation.  What he talks about I don’t know.  I haven’t\\nlistened to him for years.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Have you never forgiven him then?  How sad that seems!\\nBut all life is very, very sad, is it not?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a _mauvais quart d’heure_\\nmade up of exquisite moments.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, there are moments, certainly.  But was it something\\nvery, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did?  Did he become angry with you, and\\nsay anything that was unkind or true?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh dear, no.  Ernest is invariably calm.  That is one of\\nthe reasons he always gets on my nerves.  Nothing is so aggravating as\\ncalmness.  There is something positively brutal about the good temper of\\nmost modern men.  I wonder we women stand it as well as we do.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men’s good temper shows they are not so sensitive\\nas we are, not so finely strung.  It makes a great barrier often between\\nhusband and wife, does it not?  But I would so much like to know what was\\nthe wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell\\neverybody else.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  I will make a point of repeating\\nit.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively\\non his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course\\nof his life.  I was very young at the time, so I didn’t believe him, I\\nneedn’t tell you.  Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any\\nkind till after I had been actually married four or five months.  I found\\nout then that what he had told me was perfectly true.  And that sort of\\nthing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Men always want to be a woman’s first love.  That is their\\nclumsy vanity.  We women have a more subtle instinct about things.  What\\nwe like is to be a man’s last romance.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I see what you mean.  It’s very, very beautiful.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, you don’t mean to tell me that you won’t\\nforgive your husband because he never loved any one else?  Did you ever\\nhear such a thing, Caroline?  I am quite surprised.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that\\nnothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages.  They\\napparently are getting remarkably rare.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, they’re quite out of date.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  How like the middle classes!\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes—is it not?—very, very like them.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  If what you tell us about the middle classes is true,\\nLady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit.  It is much to be\\nregretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently\\nfrivolous, under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to\\nbe.  It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we\\nall know of in society.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don’t think the frivolity of\\nthe wife has ever anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined\\nnowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else.  How\\ncan a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating\\nher as if she were a perfectly rational being?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a\\nsex that has been rational for millions and millions of years.  He can’t\\nhelp himself.  It is in his race.  The History of Woman is very\\ndifferent.  We have always been picturesque protests against the mere\\nexistence of common sense.  We saw its dangers from the first.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly most,\\nmost trying.  Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband.  I think\\nit would be so very, very helpful.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Husband?  There couldn’t be such a thing.  The\\ninstitution is wrong.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to _us_.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  He would probably be extremely realistic.\\n\\nMRS. CAROLINE.  The Ideal Man!  Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if\\nwe were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.  He should refuse\\nall our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims.  He should\\nencourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions.  He should\\nalways say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he\\nsays.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But how could he do both, dear?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should never run down other pretty women.  That would\\nshow he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much.  No; he\\nshould be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don’t attract\\nhim.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about\\nother women.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us\\nan answer all about ourselves.  He should invariably praise us for\\nwhatever qualities he knows we haven’t got.  But he should be pitiless,\\nquite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never\\ndreamed of possessing.  He should never believe that we know the use of\\nuseful things.  That would be unforgiveable.  But he should shower on us\\neverything we don’t want.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills\\nand compliments.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat\\nus with absolute respect when we are alone.  And yet he should be always\\nready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to\\nbecome miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment’s notice, and to\\noverwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be\\npositively violent at the end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever\\nat a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner.  And\\nwhen, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has\\nrefused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised\\nnever to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters,\\nhe should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long,\\nand send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine\\nquite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he\\nwas.  And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about\\neverywhere with one’s husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one\\nwas, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if\\nhis conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really\\nbadly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in\\nthe wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman’s duty to\\nforgive, and one can do it all over again from the beginning, with\\nvariations.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How clever you are, my dear!  You never mean a single\\nword you say.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  It has been quite, quite\\nentrancing.  I must try and remember it all.  There are such a number of\\ndetails that are so very, very important.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you have not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal\\nMan is to be.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  His reward?  Oh, infinite expectation.  That is quite\\nenough for him.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But men are so terribly, terribly exacting, are they\\nnot?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  That makes no matter.  One should never surrender.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Not even to the Ideal Man?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Certainly not to him.  Unless, of course, one wants to\\ngrow tired of him.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh! . . . yes.  I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\\nDo you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?  Or are\\nthere more than one?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, my dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Going over to her_.]  What has happened?  Do tell me.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_in a low voice_]  I had completely forgotten that the\\nAmerican young lady has been in the room all the time.  I am afraid some\\nof this clever talk may have shocked her a little.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that will do her so much good!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Let us hope she didn’t understand much.  I think I had\\nbetter go over and talk to her.  [_Rises and goes across to_ HESTER\\nWORSLEY.]  Well, dear Miss Worsley. [_Sitting down beside her_.]  How\\nquiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time!  I suppose\\nyou have been reading a book?  There are so many books here in the\\nlibrary.\\n\\nHESTER.  No, I have been listening to the conversation.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You mustn’t believe everything that was said, you know,\\ndear.\\n\\nHESTER.  I didn’t believe any of it\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That is quite right, dear.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Continuing_.]  I couldn’t believe that any women could really\\nhold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your\\nguests.  [_An awkward pause_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hear you have such pleasant society in America.\\nQuite like our own in places, my son wrote to me.\\n\\nHESTER.  There are cliques in America as elsewhere, Lady Hunstanton.  But\\ntrue American society consists simply of all the good women and good men\\nwe have in our country.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What a sensible system, and I dare say quite pleasant\\ntoo.  I am afraid in England we have too many artificial social barriers.\\nWe don’t see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes.\\n\\nHESTER.  In America we have no lower classes.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a very strange arrangement!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What is that dreadful girl talking about?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  She is painfully natural, is she not?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  There are a great many things you haven’t got in America,\\nI am told, Miss Worsley.  They say you have no ruins, and no curiosities.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_To_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  What nonsense!  They have their\\nmothers and their manners.\\n\\nHESTER.  The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities, Lady\\nCaroline.  They are sent over to us every summer, regularly, in the\\nsteamers, and propose to us the day after they land.  As for ruins, we\\nare trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or\\nstone.  [_Gets up to take her fan from table_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What is that, dear?  Ah, yes, an iron Exhibition, is it\\nnot, at that place that has the curious name?\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Standing by table_.]  We are trying to build up life, Lady\\nHunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests on here.\\nThis sounds strange to you all, no doubt.  How could it sound other than\\nstrange?  You rich people in England, you don’t know how you are living.\\nHow could you know?  You shut out from your society the gentle and the\\ngood.  You laugh at the simple and the pure.  Living, as you all do, on\\nothers and by them, you sneer at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread\\nto the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season.  With all your\\npomp and wealth and art you don’t know how to live—you don’t even know\\nthat.  You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the\\nbeauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of\\nlife, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing.  You have\\nlost life’s secret.  Oh, your English society seems to me shallow,\\nselfish, foolish.  It has blinded its eyes, and stopped its ears.  It\\nlies like a leper in purple.  It sits like a dead thing smeared with\\ngold.  It is all wrong, all wrong.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I don’t think one should know of these things.  It is\\nnot very, very nice, is it?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English\\nsociety so much.  You were such a success in it.  And you were so much\\nadmired by the best people.  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said\\nof you—but it was most complimentary, and you know what an authority he\\nis on beauty.\\n\\nHESTER.  Lord Henry Weston!  I remember him, Lady Hunstanton.  A man with\\na hideous smile and a hideous past.  He is asked everywhere.  No\\ndinner-party is complete without him.  What of those whose ruin is due to\\nhim?  They are outcasts.  They are nameless.  If you met them in the\\nstreet you would turn your head away.  I don’t complain of their\\npunishment.  Let all women who have sinned be punished.\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters from terrace behind in a cloak with a lace veil\\nover her head_.  _She hears the last words and starts_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady!\\n\\nHESTER.  It is right that they should be punished, but don’t let them be\\nthe only ones to suffer.  If a man and woman have sinned, let them both\\ngo forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there.  Let them\\nboth be branded.  Set a mark, if you wish, on each, but don’t punish the\\none and let the other go free.  Don’t have one law for men and another\\nfor women.  You are unjust to women in England.  And till you count what\\nis a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man, you will always be\\nunjust, and Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of cloud,\\nwill be made dim to your eyes, or be not seen at all, or if seen, not\\nregarded.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Might I, dear Miss Worsley, as you are standing up, ask\\nyou for my cotton that is just behind you?  Thank you.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Mrs. Arbuthnot!  I am so pleased you have come\\nup.  But I didn’t hear you announced.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, I came straight in from the terrace, Lady Hunstanton,\\njust as I was.  You didn’t tell me you had a party.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Not a party.  Only a few guests who are staying in the\\nhouse, and whom you must know.  Allow me.  [_Tries to help her_.  _Rings\\nbell_.]  Caroline, this is Mrs. Arbuthnot, one of my sweetest friends.\\nLady Caroline Pontefract, Lady Stutfield, Mrs. Allonby, and my young\\nAmerican friend, Miss Worsley, who has just been telling us all how\\nwicked we are.\\n\\nHESTER.  I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly, Lady Hunstanton.\\nBut there are some things in England—\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth, I\\ndare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it,\\nwhich is much more important, Lord Illingworth would tell us.  The only\\npoint where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady Caroline’s\\nbrother, about poor Lord Henry.  He is really such good company.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nTake Mrs. Arbuthnot’s things.\\n\\n[_Exit Footman with wraps_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  Lady Caroline, I had no idea it was your brother.  I am sorry\\nfor the pain I must have caused you—I—\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  My dear Miss Worsley, the only part of your little\\nspeech, if I may so term it, with which I thoroughly agreed, was the part\\nabout my brother.  Nothing that you could possibly say could be too bad\\nfor him.  I regard Henry as infamous, absolutely infamous.  But I am\\nbound to state, as you were remarking, Jane, that he is excellent\\ncompany, and he has one of the best cooks in London, and after a good\\ndinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relations.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_to_ MISS WORSLEY]  Now, do come, dear, and make friends\\nwith Mrs. Arbuthnot.  She is one of the good, sweet, simple people you\\ntold us we never admitted into society.  I am sorry to say Mrs. Arbuthnot\\ncomes very rarely to me.  But that is not my fault.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a bore it is the men staying so long after dinner!  I\\nexpect they are saying the most dreadful things about us.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really think so?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I was sure of it.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very horrid of them!  Shall we go onto the\\nterrace?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, anything to get away from the dowagers and the\\ndowdies.  [_Rises and goes with_ LADY STUTFIELD _to door_ L.C.]  We are\\nonly going to look at the stars, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You will find a great many, dear, a great many.  But\\ndon’t catch cold.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  We shall all miss Gerald so\\nmuch, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But has Lord Illingworth really offered to make Gerald\\nhis secretary?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, yes!  He has been most charming about it.  He has\\nthe highest possible opinion of your boy.  You don’t know Lord\\nIllingworth, I believe, dear.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have never met him.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You know him by name, no doubt?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am afraid I don’t.  I live so much out of the world,\\nand see so few people.  I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord\\nIllingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes.  That would be the last Earl but one.  He was\\na very curious man.  He wanted to marry beneath him.  Or wouldn’t, I\\nbelieve.  There was some scandal about it.  The present Lord Illingworth\\nis quite different.  He is very distinguished.  He does—well, he does\\nnothing, which I am afraid our pretty American visitor here thinks very\\nwrong of anybody, and I don’t know that he cares much for the subjects in\\nwhich you are so interested, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Do you think,\\nCaroline, that Lord Illingworth is interested in the Housing of the Poor?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I should fancy not at all, Jane.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  We all have our different tastes, have we not?  But\\nLord Illingworth has a very high position, and there is nothing he\\ncouldn’t get if he chose to ask for it.  Of course, he is comparatively a\\nyoung man still, and he has only come to his title within—how long\\nexactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworth succeeded?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  About four years, I think, Jane.  I know it was the same\\nyear in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I remember.  That would be about four years ago.\\nOf course, there were a great many people between the present Lord\\nIllingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  There was—who was there,\\nCaroline?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  There was poor Margaret’s baby.  You remember how anxious\\nshe was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and her husband\\ndied shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of Lord\\nAscot’s sons, who, I am told, beats her.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the family.\\nAnd there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic,\\nor a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know the\\nCourt of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that he was quite\\nsane.  And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumstead’s with straws in\\nhis hair, or something very odd about him.  I can’t recall what.  I often\\nregret, Lady Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son\\nget the title.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Cecilia?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Lord Illingworth’s mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, was one\\nof the Duchess of Jerningham’s pretty daughters, and she married Sir\\nThomas Harford, who wasn’t considered a very good match for her at the\\ntime, though he was said to be the handsomest man in London.  I knew them\\nall quite intimately, and both the sons, Arthur and George.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course, Lady\\nHunstanton?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field.  Or was\\nit fishing, Caroline?  I forget.  But George came in for everything.  I\\nalways tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has\\nhad.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once.\\nMight I see him?  Can he be sent for?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, dear.  I will send one of the servants into\\nthe dining-room to fetch him.  I don’t know what keeps the gentlemen so\\nlong.  [_Rings bell_.]  When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain\\nGeorge Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young man about town, with\\nnot a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him.  She\\nwas quite devoted to him.  Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms\\nwith his father.  Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon.  [_To Servant_.]  It\\ndoesn’t matter.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ DOCTOR DAUBENY.  SIR JOHN _goes over to_ LADY\\nSTUTFIELD, DOCTOR DAUBENY _to_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining.  I have\\nnever enjoyed myself more.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_To_ DOCTOR BAUBENY.]  You see I have got Mrs.\\nArbuthnot to come to me at last.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton.  Mrs. Daubeny\\nwill be quite jealous of you.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come with you\\nto-night.  Headache as usual, I suppose.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.  But she is\\nhappiest alone.  She is happiest alone.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_To her husband_.]  John!  [SIR JOHN _goes over to his\\nwife_.  DOCTOR BAUBENY _talks to_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT watches LORD ILLINGWORTH the whole time.  He has passed\\nacross the room without noticing her, and approaches MRS. ALLONBY, who\\nwith LADY STUTFIELD is standing by the door looking on to the terrace.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How is the most charming woman in the world?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [Taking LADY STUTFIELD by the hand.]  We are both quite\\nwell, thank you, Lord Illingworth.  But what a short time you have been\\nin the dining-room!  It seems as if we had only just left.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was bored to death.  Never opened my lips the whole\\ntime.  Absolutely longing to come in to you.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You should have.  The American girl has been giving us a\\nlecture.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Really?  All Americans lecture, I believe.  I suppose\\nit is something in their climate.  What did she lecture about?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Puritanism, of course.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am going to convert her, am I not?  How long do you\\ngive me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  A week.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A week is more than enough.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Going to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Dear mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, I don’t feel at all well.  See me home, Gerald.\\nI shouldn’t have come.\\n\\nGERALD.  I am so sorry, mother.  Certainly.  But you must know Lord\\nIllingworth first.  [_Goes across room_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Not to-night, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know my mother.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  With the greatest pleasure.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\nI’ll be back in a moment.  People’s mothers always bore me to death.  All\\nwomen become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  No man does.  That is his.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a delightful mood you are in to-night!  [_Turns\\nround and goes across with_ GERALD _to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  _When he sees\\nher_, _he starts back in wonder_.  _Then slowly his eyes turn towards_\\nGERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has offered to take me as\\nhis private secretary.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _bows coldly_.]  It is a\\nwonderful opening for me, isn’t it?  I hope he won’t be disappointed in\\nme, that is all.  You’ll thank Lord Illingworth, mother, won’t you?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth in very good, I am sure, to interest\\nhimself in you for the moment.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Putting his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  Oh,\\nGerald and I are great friends already, Mrs . . . Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There can be nothing in common between you and my son,\\nLord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, how can you say so?  Of course Lord Illingworth is\\nawfully clever and that sort of thing.  There is nothing Lord Illingworth\\ndoesn’t know.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy!\\n\\nGERALD.  He knows more about life than any one I have ever met.  I feel\\nan awful duffer when I am with you, Lord Illingworth.  Of course, I have\\nhad so few advantages.  I have not been to Eton or Oxford like other\\nchaps.  But Lord Illingworth doesn’t seem to mind that.  He has been\\nawfully good to me, mother.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth may change his mind.  He may not really\\nwant you as his secretary.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You must remember, as you said yourself, you have had so\\nfew advantages.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for a moment.  Do\\ncome over.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Will you excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot?  Now, don’t let\\nyour charming mother make any more difficulties, Gerald.  The thing is\\nquite settled, isn’t it?\\n\\nGERALD.  I hope so.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _goes across to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I thought you were never going to leave the lady in black\\nvelvet.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is excessively handsome.  [_Looks at_ MRS.\\nARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room?\\nMiss Worsley is going to play.  You’ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,\\nwon’t you?  You don’t know what a treat is in store for you.  [_To_\\nDOCTOR BAUBENY.]  I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to\\nthe rectory.  I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the\\nviolin.  Ah, I forgot.  Dear Mrs. Daubeny’s hearing is a little\\ndefective, is it not?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Her deafness is a great privation to her.  She can’t\\neven hear my sermons now.  She reads them at home.  But she has many\\nresources in herself, many resources.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She reads a good deal, I suppose?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Just the very largest print.  The eyesight is rapidly\\ngoing.  But she’s never morbid, never morbid.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  Do speak to my mother, Lord\\nIllingworth, before you go into the music-room.  She seems to think,\\nsomehow, you don’t mean what you said to me.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Aren’t you coming?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  In a few moments.  Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot\\nwould allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join\\nyou later on.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, of course.  You will have a great deal to say to\\nher, and she will have a great deal to thank you for.  It is not every\\nson who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  But I know you appreciate\\nthat, dear.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, don’t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord\\nIllingworth.  We can’t spare her.\\n\\n[_Exit following the other guests_.  _Sound of violin heard from\\nmusic-room_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So that is our son, Rachel!  Well, I am very proud of\\nhim.  He in a Harford, every inch of him.  By the way, why Arbuthnot,\\nRachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  One name is as good as another, when one has no right to\\nany name.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose so—but why Gerald?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  After a man whose heart I broke—after my father.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Well, Rachel, what in over is over.  All I have got to\\nsay now in that I am very, very much pleased with our boy.  The world\\nwill know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will be\\nsomething very near, and very dear.  It is a curious thing, Rachel; my\\nlife seemed to be quite complete.  It was not so.  It lacked something,\\nit lacked a son.  I have found my son now, I am glad I have found him.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You have no right to claim him, or the smallest part of\\nhim.  The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over\\ntwenty years.  Why not let me have him for a little now?  He is quite as\\nmuch mine as yours.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Are you talking of the child you abandoned?  Of the\\nchild who, as far as you are concerned, might have died of hunger and of\\nwant?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me.  It was\\nnot I who left you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I left you because you refused to give the child a name.\\nBefore my son was born, I implored you to marry me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I had no expectations then.  And besides, Rachel, I\\nwasn’t much older than you were.  I was only twenty-two.  I was\\ntwenty-one, I believe, when the whole thing began in your father’s\\ngarden.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old\\nenough to do right also.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities are always\\ninteresting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.  As for\\nsaying I left our child to starve, that, of course, is untrue and silly.\\nMy mother offered you six hundred a year.  But you wouldn’t take\\nanything.  You simply disappeared, and carried the child away with you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I wouldn’t have accepted a penny from her.  Your father\\nwas different.  He told you, in my presence, when we were in Paris, that\\nit was your duty to marry me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, duty is what one expects from others, it is not\\nwhat one does oneself.  Of course, I was influenced by my mother.  Every\\nman is when he is young.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am glad to hear you say so.  Gerald shall certainly\\nnot go away with you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What nonsense, Rachel!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Do you think I would allow my son—\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  _Our_ son.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son [LORD ILLINGWORTH _shrugs his shoulders_]—to go\\naway with the man who spoiled my youth, who ruined my life, who has\\ntainted every moment of my days?  You don’t realise what my past has been\\nin suffering and in shame.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, I must candidly say that I think\\nGerald’s future considerably more important than your past.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald cannot separate his future from my past.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is exactly what he should do.  That is exactly\\nwhat you should help him to do.  What a typical woman you are!  You talk\\nsentimentally, and you are thoroughly selfish the whole time.  But don’t\\nlet us have a scene.  Rachel, I want you to look at this matter from the\\ncommon-sense point of view, from the point of view of what is best for\\nour son, leaving you and me out of the question.  What is our son at\\npresent?  An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank in a third-rate\\nEnglish town.  If you imagine he is quite happy in such a position, you\\nare mistaken.  He is thoroughly discontented.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He was not discontented till he met you.  You have made\\nhim so.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Of course, I made him so.  Discontent is the first\\nstep in the progress of a man or a nation.  But I did not leave him with\\na mere longing for things he could not get.  No, I made him a charming\\noffer.  He jumped at it, I need hardly say.  Any young man would.  And\\nnow, simply because it turns out that I am the boy’s own father and he my\\nown son, you propose practically to ruin his career.  That is to say, if\\nI were a perfect stranger, you would allow Gerald to go away with me, but\\nas he is my own flesh and blood you won’t.  How utterly illogical you\\nare!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not allow him to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How can you prevent it?  What excuse can you give to\\nhim for making him decline such an offer as mine?  I won’t tell him in\\nwhat relations I stand to him, I need hardly say.  But you daren’t tell\\nhim.  You know that.  Look how you have brought him up.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have brought him up to be a good man.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  And what is the result?  You have educated\\nhim to be your judge if he ever finds you out.  And a bitter, an unjust\\njudge he will be to you.  Don’t be deceived, Rachel.  Children begin by\\nloving their parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely, if ever, do\\nthey forgive them.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  George, don’t take my son away from me.  I have had\\ntwenty years of sorrow, and I have only had one thing to love me, only\\none thing to love.  You have had a life of joy, and pleasure, and\\nsuccess.  You have been quite happy, you have never thought of us.  There\\nwas no reason, according to your views of life, why you should have\\nremembered us at all.  Your meeting us was a mere accident, a horrible\\naccident.  Forget it.  Don’t come now, and rob me of . . . of all I have\\nin the whole world.  You are so rich in other things.  Leave me the\\nlittle vineyard of my life; leave me the walled-in garden and the well of\\nwater; the ewe-lamb God sent me, in pity or in wrath, oh! leave me that.\\nGeorge, don’t take Gerald from me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, at the present moment you are not necessary to\\nGerald’s career; I am.  There is nothing more to be said on the subject.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not let him go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Here is Gerald.  He has a right to decide for himself.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother, I hope you have settled it all with Lord\\nIllingworth?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have not, Gerald.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother seems not to like your coming with me, for\\nsome reason.\\n\\nGERALD.  Why, mother?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I thought you were quite happy here with me, Gerald.  I\\ndidn’t know you were so anxious to leave me.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, how can you talk like that?  Of course I have been quite\\nhappy with you.  But a man can’t stay always with his mother.  No chap\\ndoes.  I want to make myself a position, to do something.  I thought you\\nwould have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth’s secretary.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not think you would be suitable as a private\\nsecretary to Lord Illingworth.  You have no qualifications.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs.\\nArbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I surely am\\nthe best judge.  And I can only tell you that your son has all the\\nqualifications I had hoped for.  He has more, in fact, than I had even\\nthought of.  Far more.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _remains silent_.]  Have you any\\nother reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don’t wish your son to accept this\\npost?\\n\\nGERALD.  Have you, mother?  Do answer.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.  We\\nare quite by ourselves here.  Whatever it is, I need not say I will not\\nrepeat it.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you would like to be alone with your son, I will\\nleave you.  You may have some other reason you don’t wish me to hear.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have no other reason.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing as\\nsettled.  Come, you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together.\\nAnd Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I think you have acted\\nvery, very wisely.\\n\\n[_Exit with_ GERALD.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is left alone_.  _She stands\\nimmobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face_.]\\n\\n                                 ACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHIRD ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n    _The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_.  _Door at back leading on to\\n                                terrace_.\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a\\nsofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I\\nknew she would come round in the end.\\n\\nGERALD.  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know\\nshe doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is\\nperfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I\\ncouldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value\\nwhatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is\\nnot a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.\\n\\nGERALD.  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on\\nyour side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing\\nlike youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in\\nlife’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom\\nwaiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,\\nlike most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I\\nwouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of\\nthe community.\\n\\nGERALD.  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.\\nI sometimes think she must have married beneath her.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts\\nhis hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father,\\nI suppose, Gerald?\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such\\na mother as I have had.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that\\nmost mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,\\nthat a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.\\nAfter all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such\\na hole as Wrockley, could you?\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is\\noften curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in\\nit.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Slowly_.]  I suppose there is.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good\\nwomen have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their\\ninterests are so petty, aren’t they?\\n\\nGERALD.  They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care\\nmuch about.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort\\nof thing.\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, yes, she’s always going to church.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only\\nthing worth being nowadays.  You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?\\nYou want to know life as it really is.  Not to be put of with any\\nold-fashioned theories about life.  Well, what you have to do at present\\nis simply to fit yourself for the best society.  A man who can dominate a\\nLondon dinner-table can dominate the world.  The future belongs to the\\ndandy.  It is the exquisites who are going to rule.\\n\\nGERALD.  I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always\\nbeen told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that\\nthey don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial.  By the way,\\nGerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.  Sentiment is all\\nvery well for the button-hole.  But the essential thing for a necktie is\\nstyle.  A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Laughing_.]  I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord\\nIllingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know\\nhow to talk.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to\\nevery man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you\\nwill have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.\\n\\nGERALD.  But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either\\nto feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!\\n\\nGERALD.  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of it\\nsimply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any real\\nsuccess in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule\\nsociety.  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.  You\\nmight just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at\\nonce.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You should never try to understand them.  Women are\\npictures.  Men are problems.  If you want to know what a woman really\\nmeans—which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do—look at her,\\ndon’t listen to her.\\n\\nGERALD.  But women are awfully clever, aren’t they?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always tell them so.  But, to the\\nphilosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over\\nmind—just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.\\n\\nGERALD.  How then can women have so much power as you say they have?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The history of women is the history of the worst form\\nof tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak over the\\nstrong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.\\n\\nGERALD.  But haven’t women got a refining influence?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Nothing refines but the intellect.\\n\\nGERALD.  Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren’t there?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.\\n\\nGERALD.  But there are good women in society, aren’t there?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Far too many.\\n\\nGERALD.  But do you think women shouldn’t be good?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never tell them so, they’d all become good\\nat once.  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.  Every woman is a rebel,\\nand usually in wild revolt against herself.\\n\\nGERALD.  You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Men marry because they are tired; women because they\\nare curious.  Both are disappointed.\\n\\nGERALD.  But don’t you think one can be happy when one is married?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Perfectly happy.  But the happiness of a married man,\\nmy dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.\\n\\nGERALD.  But if one is in love?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always be in love.  That is the reason one\\nshould never marry.\\n\\nGERALD.  Love is a very wonderful thing, isn’t it?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself.\\nAnd one ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a\\nromance.  But a really _grande passion_ is comparatively rare nowadays.\\nIt is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.  That is the one\\nuse of the idle classes in a country, and the only possible explanation\\nof us Harfords.\\n\\nGERALD.  Harfords, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is my family name.  You should study the Peerage,\\nGerald.  It is the one book a young man about town should know\\nthoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever\\ndone.  And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectly new life with me,\\nand I want you to know how to live.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _appears on terrace\\nbehind_.]  For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live\\nin it!\\n\\n[_Enter_ L.C. LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ DR. DAUBENY.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! here you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  Well, I\\nsuppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new\\nduties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good advice over a\\npleasant cigarette.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady\\nHunstanton, and the best of cigarettes.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I\\nsuppose I am too old now to learn.  Except from you, dear Archdeacon,\\nwhen you are in your nice pulpit.  But then I always know what you are\\ngoing to say, so I don’t feel alarmed.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah!\\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.  Come, dear.  [_Enter_ MRS.\\nARBUTHNOT.]  Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord\\nIllingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant\\nway in which everything has turned out for him.  Let us sit down.  [_They\\nsit down_.]  And how is your beautiful embroidery going on?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn’t she?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas.\\nBut the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal.  She has not touched\\nthe tambour frame for nine or ten years.  But she has many other\\namusements.  She is very much interested in her own health.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that is always a nice distraction, in it not?  Now,\\nwhat are you talking about, Lord Illingworth?  Do tell us.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the\\nworld has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in\\nwhich it has been able to bear them.  And that, consequently, whatever\\nthe world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now I am quite out of my depth.  I usually am when Lord\\nIllingworth says anything.  And the Humane Society is most careless.\\nThey never rescue me.  I am left to sink.  I have a dim idea, dear Lord\\nIllingworth, that you are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I\\nalways try to be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get.\\nAnd after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The only difference between the saint and the sinner\\nis that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that quite does for me.  I haven’t a word to say.\\nYou and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age.  We can’t follow Lord\\nIllingworth.  Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid.\\nTo have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays.  It shuts one\\nout from so much.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of\\nhis opinions.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are quite right, dear.\\n\\n[GERALD _shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother_.\\n_Enter_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Jane, have you seen John anywhere?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You needn’t be anxious about him, dear.  He is with\\nLady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room.\\nThey seem quite happy together.  You are not going, Caroline?  Pray sit\\ndown.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think I had better look after John.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It doesn’t do to pay men so much attention.  And\\nCaroline has really nothing to be anxious about.  Lady Stutfield is very\\nsympathetic.  She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about\\nanother.  A beautiful nature.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nAh! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs. Allonby too!  I suppose it was Mrs.\\nAllonby I saw him with.  Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere\\nfor you.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady\\nHunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! the Music-room, of course.  I thought it was the\\nYellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.  [_To the_\\nARCHDEACON.]  Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn’t she?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She used to be quite remarkable for her memory, but\\nsince her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early\\nchildhood.  But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great\\npleasure.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY STUTFIELD _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil been\\ntalking to you about?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Bimetallism!  Is that quite a nice subject?  However, I\\nknow people discuss everything very freely nowadays.  What did Sir John\\ntalk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  About Patagonia.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a remote topic!  But very improving, I\\nhave no doubt.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia.\\nSavages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost\\nall subjects.  They are excessively advanced.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What do they do?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Apparently everything.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it\\nnot, to find that Human Nature is permanently one.—On the whole, the\\nworld is the same world, is it not?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The world is simply divided into two classes—those who\\nbelieve the incredible, like the public—and those who do the improbable—\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Like yourself?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Yes; I am always astonishing myself.  It is the only\\nthing that makes life worth living.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful\\nqualities in my own nature.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah! don’t become quite perfect all at once.  Do it\\ngradually!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t intend to grow perfect at all.  At least, I\\nhope I shan’t.  It would be most inconvenient.  Women love us for our\\ndefects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything,\\neven our gigantic intellects.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis.  We forgive\\nadoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from us.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.  _He joins_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn’t we,\\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot?  I am sure you agree with me in that.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many\\nthings women should never forgive.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What sort of things?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The ruin of another woman’s life.\\n\\n[_Moves slowly away to back of stage_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe\\nthere are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and\\nreformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take\\nthings very, very easily.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is\\nunbecoming.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of\\nbeing terribly, terribly deceived.\\n\\nKELVIL.  The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  There is no secret of life.  Life’s aim, if it has\\none, is simply to be always looking for temptations.  There are not\\nnearly enough.  I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a\\nsingle one.  It is quite dreadful.  It makes one so nervous about the\\nfuture.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Shakes her fan at him_.]  I don’t know how it is,\\ndear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me\\nexcessively immoral.  It has been most interesting, listening to you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  All thought is immoral.  Its very essence is\\ndestruction.  If you think of anything, you kill it.  Nothing survives\\nbeing thought of.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t understand a word, Lord Illingworth.  But I\\nhave no doubt it is all quite true.  Personally, I have very little to\\nreproach myself with, on the score of thinking.  I don’t believe in women\\nthinking too much.  Women should think in moderation, as they should do\\nall things in moderation.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.  Nothing\\nsucceeds like excess.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope I shall remember that.  It sounds an admirable\\nmaxim.  But I’m beginning to forget everything.  It’s a great misfortune.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady\\nHunstanton.  No woman should have a memory.  Memory in a woman is the\\nbeginning of dowdiness.  One can always tell from a woman’s bonnet\\nwhether she has got a memory or not.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  You\\nalways find out that one’s most glaring fault is one’s most important\\nvirtue.  You have the most comforting views of life.\\n\\n[_Enter_ FARQUHAR.]\\n\\nFARQUHAR.  Doctor Daubeny’s carriage!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Archdeacon!  It is only half-past ten.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  [_Rising_.]  I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton.\\nTuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny’s bad nights.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  Well, I won’t keep you from her.  [_Goes\\nwith him towards door_.]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of\\npartridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never touches\\nsolids now.  Lives entirely on jellies.  But she is wonderfully cheerful,\\nwonderfully cheerful.  She has nothing to complain of.\\n\\n[_Exit with_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Goes over to_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  There is a beautiful\\nmoon to-night.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Let us go and look at it.  To look at anything that is\\ninconstant is charming nowadays.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You have your looking-glass.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is unkind.  It merely shows me my wrinkles.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Mine is better behaved.  It never tells me the truth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then it is in love with you.\\n\\n[_Exeunt_ SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH]  May I come too?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do, my dear boy.  [_Moves towards with_ MRS. ALLONBY\\n_and_ GERALD.]\\n\\n[LADY CAROLINE _enters_, _looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite\\ndirection to that taken by_ SIR JOHN _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  What, mother!\\n\\n[_Exit_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is getting late.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother.  Do let us wait a little longer.  Lord\\nIllingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a great\\nsurprise for you.  We are starting for India at the end of this month.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid\\ngood-bye to Lord Illingworth first.  I’ll be back in five minutes.\\n[_Exit_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him—not\\nwith him!  I couldn’t bear it.  [_Walks up and down_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER.]\\n\\nHESTER.  What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Is it?\\n\\nHESTER.  Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You are so\\ndifferent from the other women here.  When you came into the Drawing-room\\nthis evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and\\npure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are things that are right to\\nsay, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.\\n\\nHESTER.  I didn’t know you had heard it.  But I knew you would agree with\\nme.  A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn’t she?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  She shouldn’t be allowed to come into the society of good men\\nand women?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  She should not.\\n\\nHESTER.  And the man should be punished in the same way?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  In the same way.  And the children, if there are\\nchildren, in the same way also?\\n\\nHESTER.  Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited\\non the children.  It is a just law.  It is God’s law.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is one of God’s terrible laws.\\n\\n[_Moves away to fireplace_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth?  Of course\\nthere is position, no doubt, and money, but position and money are not\\neverything, are they?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  They are nothing; they bring misery.\\n\\nHESTER.  Then why do you let your son go with him?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He wishes it himself.\\n\\nHESTER.  But if you asked him he would stay, would he not?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He has set his heart on going.\\n\\nHESTER.  He couldn’t refuse you anything.  He loves you too much.  Ask\\nhim to stay.  Let me send him in to you.  He is on the terrace at this\\nmoment with Lord Illingworth.  I heard them laughing together as I passed\\nthrough the Music-room.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.  It is of no\\nconsequence.\\n\\nHESTER.  No, I’ll tell him you want him.  Do—do ask him to stay.  [_Exit_\\nHESTER.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He won’t come—I know he won’t come.\\n\\n[Enter LADY CAROLINE.  _She looks round anxiously_.  _Enter_ GERALD.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the\\nterrace?\\n\\nGERALD.  No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is very curious.  It is time for him to retire.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting.  I forgot all about\\nit.  I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so happy.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  At the prospect of going away?\\n\\nGERALD.  Don’t put it like that, mother.  Of course I am sorry to leave\\nyou.  Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.  But after all, as\\nLord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a place as\\nWrockley.  You don’t mind it.  But I’m ambitions; I want something more\\nthan that.  I want to have a career.  I want to do something that will\\nmake you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth is going to help me.  He is\\ngoing to do everything for me.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, don’t go away with Lord Illingworth.  I implore\\nyou not to.  Gerald, I beg you!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, how changeable you are!  You don’t seem to know your own\\nmind for a single moment.  An hour and a half ago in the Drawing-room you\\nagreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and make objections, and\\ntry to force me to give up my one chance in life.  Yes, my one chance.\\nYou don’t suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every\\nday, do you, mother?  It is very strange that when I have had such a\\nwonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties in my\\nway should be my own mother.  Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester\\nWorsley.  Who could help loving her?  I love her more than I have ever\\ntold you, far more.  And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I\\ncould—I could ask her to—Don’t you understand now, mother, what it means\\nto me to be Lord Illingworth’s secretary?  To start like that is to find\\na career ready for one—before one—waiting for one.  If I were Lord\\nIllingworth’s secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.  As a wretched\\nbank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.  I know\\nher views on life.  She has just told them to me.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Then I have my ambition left, at any rate.  That is something—I\\nam glad I have that!  You have always tried to crush my ambition,\\nmother—haven’t you?  You have told me that the world is a wicked place,\\nthat success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that\\nsort of thing—well, I don’t believe it, mother.  I think the world must\\nbe delightful.  I think society must be exquisite.  I think success is a\\nthing worth having.  You have been wrong in all that you taught me,\\nmother, quite wrong.  Lord Illingworth is a successful man.  He is a\\nfashionable man.  He is a man who lives in the world and for it.  Well, I\\nwould give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I would sooner see you dead.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth?  Tell\\nme—tell me right out.  What is it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is a bad man.\\n\\nGERALD.  In what way bad?  I don’t understand what you mean.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will tell you.\\n\\nGERALD.  I suppose you think him bad, because he doesn’t believe the same\\nthings as you do.  Well, men are different from women, mother.  It is\\nnatural that they should have different views.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is not what Lord Illingworth believes, or what he\\ndoes not believe, that makes him bad.  It is what he is.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, is it something you know of him?  Something you actually\\nknow?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is something I know.\\n\\nGERALD.  Something you are quite sure of?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Quite sure of.\\n\\nGERALD.  How long have you known it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For twenty years.\\n\\nGERALD.  Is it fair to go back twenty years in any man’s career?  And\\nwhat have you or I to do with Lord Illingworth’s early life?  What\\nbusiness is it of ours?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What this man has been, he is now, and will be always.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did?  If he did anything\\nshameful, I will not go away with him.  Surely you know me well enough\\nfor that?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, come near to me.  Quite close to me, as you used\\nto do when you were a little boy, when you were mother’s own boy.\\n[GERALD _sits down betide his mother_.  _She runs her fingers through his\\nhair_, _and strokes his hands_.]  Gerald, there was a girl once, she was\\nvery young, she was little over eighteen at the time.  George\\nHarford—that was Lord Illingworth’s name then—George Harford met her.\\nShe knew nothing about life.  He—knew everything.  He made this girl love\\nhim.  He made her love him so much that she left her father’s house with\\nhim one morning.  She loved him so much, and he had promised to marry\\nher!  He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him.\\nShe was very young, and—and ignorant of what life really is.  But he put\\nthe marriage off from week to week, and month to month.—She trusted in\\nhim all the while.  She loved him.—Before her child was born—for she had\\na child—she implored him for the child’s sake to marry her, that the\\nchild might have a name, that her sin might not be visited on the child,\\nwho was innocent.  He refused.  After the child was born she left him,\\ntaking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and\\nall that was sweet, and good, and pure in her ruined also.  She suffered\\nterribly—she suffers now.  She will always suffer.  For her there is no\\njoy, no peace, no atonement.  She is a woman who drags a chain like a\\nguilty thing.  She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing that is a\\nleper.  The fire cannot purify her.  The waters cannot quench her\\nanguish.  Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her sleep! no poppies\\nforgetfulness!  She is lost!  She is a lost soul!—That is why I call Lord\\nIllingworth a bad man.  That is why I don’t want my boy to be with him.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of course.  But I\\ndare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth\\nwas.—After all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice feelings\\nat all, go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married, and\\nlive with him as his wife?  No nice girl would.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_After a pause_.]  Gerald, I withdraw all my\\nobjections.  You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth, when\\nand where you choose.\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I knew you wouldn’t stand in my way.  You are the\\nbest woman God ever made.  And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don’t believe\\nhe is capable of anything infamous or base.  I can’t believe it of him—I\\ncan’t.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Outside_.]  Let me go!  Let me go!  [_Enter_ HESTER _in\\nterror_, _and rushes over to_ GERALD _and flings herself in his arms_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  Oh! save me—save me from him!\\n\\nGERALD.  From whom?\\n\\nHESTER.  He has insulted me!  Horribly insulted me!  Save me!\\n\\nGERALD.  Who?  Who has dared—?\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters at back of stage_.  HESTER _breaks from_\\nGERALD’S _arms and points to him_.]\\n\\nGERALD  [_He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation_.]  Lord\\nIllingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God’s earth, a thing\\nas pure as my own mother.  You have insulted the woman I love most in the\\nworld with my own mother.  As there is a God in Heaven, I will kill you!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rushing across and catching hold of him_]  No! no!\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Thrusting her back_.]  Don’t hold me, mother.  Don’t hold\\nme—I’ll kill him!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  Let me go, I say!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Stop, Gerald, stop!  He is your own father!\\n\\n[GERALD _clutches his mother’s hands and looks into her face_.  _She\\nsinks slowly on the ground in shame_.  HESTER _steals towards the door_.\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH _frowns and bites his lip_.  _After a time_ GERALD\\n_raises his mother up_, _puts his am round her_, _and leads her from the\\nroom_.]\\n\\n                                 ACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOURTH ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n_Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s_.  _Large open French window at back_,\\n_looking on to garden_.  _Doors_ R.C. _and_ L.C.\\n\\n[GERALD ARBUTHNOT _writing at table_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ ALICE R.C. _followed by_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nALICE.  Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\n[_Exit_ L.C.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Good morning, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Rising_.]  Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs.\\nAllonby.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  We came to inquire for your dear\\nmother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?\\n\\nGERALD.  My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last\\nnight.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it\\nwas the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets\\non one’s nerves.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It’s the same thing, nowadays.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am\\nafraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.\\nArbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]  It looks\\nquite the happy English home.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.\\nOne feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,\\nGerald.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that\\na good influence is the worst in the world.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he\\nwill change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English\\nhome.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women\\nin London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but\\norchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a\\nsweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures\\nthat one can look at without blushing.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But I like blushing.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,\\nif one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell\\nme I didn’t blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very\\nparticular.  He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those\\nwho were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,\\nwas brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the\\ndevotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?\\nBy-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more\\noften now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you?\\n\\nGERALD.  I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s\\nsecretary.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Surely not, Gerald!  It would be most unwise of you.\\nWhat reason can you have?\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t think I should be suitable for the post.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.\\nBut he says I am not serious enough.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, you really mustn’t talk like that in this\\nhouse.  Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn’t know anything about the wicked society in\\nwhich we all live.  She won’t go into it.  She is far too good.  I\\nconsider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.  It gave\\nquite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in\\nthe air.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, how can you say that?  There is no resemblance\\nbetween the two things at all.  But really, Gerald, what do you mean by\\nnot being suitable?\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth’s views of life and mine are too different.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn’t have any\\nviews of life.  They are quite out of place.  You must be guided by\\nothers in this matter.  Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering\\noffer, and travelling with him you would see the world—as much of it, at\\nleast, as one should look at—under the best auspices possible, and stay\\nwith all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in\\nyour career.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t want to see the world: I’ve seen enough of it.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I hope you don’t think you have exhausted life, Mr.\\nArbuthnot.  When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t wish to leave my mother.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part.  Not\\nleave your mother!  If I were your mother I would insist on your going.\\n\\n[_Enter_ ALICE L.C.]\\n\\nALICE.  Mrs. Arbuthnot’s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad\\nheadache, and cannot see any one this morning.  [_Exit_ R.C.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps\\nyou’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better,\\nGerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, to-morrow, then.  Ah, if you had a father,\\nGerald, he wouldn’t let you waste your life here.  He would send you off\\nwith Lord Illingworth at once.  But mothers are so weak.  They give up to\\ntheir sons in everything.  We are all heart, all heart.  Come, dear, I\\nmust call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid,\\nis far from well.  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite\\nwonderful.  He is the most sympathetic of husbands.  Quite a model.\\nGood-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nGERALD.  Good-bye.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.  GERALD _sits down and reads\\nover his letter_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  What name can I sign?  I, who have no right to any name.\\n[_Signs name_, _puts letter into envelope_, _addresses it_, _and is about\\nto seal it_, _when door_ L.C. _opens and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters_.\\nGERALD _lays down sealing-wax_.  _Mother and son look at each other_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Through French window at the back_.]  Good-bye again,\\nGerald.  We are taking the short cut across your pretty garden.  Now,\\nremember my advice to you—start at once with Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  _Au revoir_, Mr. Arbuthnot.  Mind you bring me back\\nsomething nice from your travels—not an Indian shawl—on no account an\\nIndian shawl.\\n\\n[_Exeunt_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I have just written to him.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  To whom?\\n\\nGERALD.  To my father.  I have written to tell him to come here at four\\no’clock this afternoon.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He shall not come here.  He shall not cross the\\nthreshold of my house.\\n\\nGERALD.  He must come.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, if you are going away with Lord Illingworth, go\\nat once.  Go before it kills me: but don’t ask me to meet him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you don’t understand.  Nothing in the world would induce\\nme to go away with Lord Illingworth, or to leave you.  Surely you know me\\nwell enough for that.  No: I have written to him to say—\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What can you have to say to him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Can’t you guess, mother, what I have written in this letter?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, surely you can.  Think, think what must be done, now, at\\nonce, within the next few days.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is nothing to be done.\\n\\nGERALD.  I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him that he must\\nmarry you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Marry me?\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I will force him to do it.  The wrong that has been done\\nyou must be repaired.  Atonement must be made.  Justice may be slow,\\nmother, but it comes in the end.  In a few days you shall be Lord\\nIllingworth’s lawful wife.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald—\\n\\nGERALD.  I will insist upon his doing it.  I will make him do it: he will\\nnot dare to refuse.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald, it is I who refuse.  I will not marry Lord\\nIllingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  Not marry him?  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  But you don’t understand: it is for your sake I am talking, not\\nfor mine.  This marriage, this necessary marriage, this marriage which\\nfor obvious reasons must inevitably take place, will not help me, will\\nnot give me a name that will be really, rightly mine to bear.  But surely\\nit will be something for you, that you, my mother, should, however late,\\nbecome the wife of the man who is my father.  Will not that be something?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you must.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not.  You talk of atonement for a wrong done.\\nWhat atonement can be made to me?  There is no atonement possible.  I am\\ndisgraced: he is not.  That is all.  It is the usual history of a man and\\na woman as it usually happens, as it always happens.  And the ending is\\nthe ordinary ending.  The woman suffers.  The man goes free.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t know if that is the ordinary ending, mother: I hope it\\nis not.  But your life, at any rate, shall not end like that.  The man\\nshall make whatever reparation is possible.  It is not enough.  It does\\nnot wipe out the past, I know that.  But at least it makes the future\\nbetter, better for you, mother.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would\\ngive him a different answer.  Remember, he is my father.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  If he came himself, which he will not do, my answer\\nwould be the same.  Remember I am your mother.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you make it terribly difficult for me by talking like\\nthat; and I can’t understand why you won’t look at this matter from the\\nright, from the only proper standpoint.  It is to take away the\\nbitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow that lies on your\\nname, that this marriage must take place.  There is no alternative: and\\nafter the marriage you and I can go away together.  But the marriage must\\ntake place first.  It is a duty that you owe, not merely to yourself, but\\nto all other women—yes: to all the other women in the world, lest he\\nbetray more.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I owe nothing to other women.  There is not one of them\\nto help me.  There is not one woman in the world to whom I could go for\\npity, if I would take it, or for sympathy, if I could win it.  Women are\\nhard on each other.  That girl, last night, good though she is, fled from\\nthe room as though I were a tainted thing.  She was right.  I am a\\ntainted thing.  But my wrongs are my own, and I will bear them alone.  I\\nmust bear them alone.  What have women who have not sinned to do with me,\\nor I with them?  We do not understand each other.\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER _behind_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  I implore you to do what I ask you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What son has ever asked of his mother to make so hideous\\na sacrifice?  None.\\n\\nGERALD.  What mother has ever refused to marry the father of her own\\nchild?  None.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let me be the first, then.  I will not do it.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you believe in religion, and you brought me up to\\nbelieve in it also.  Well, surely your religion, the religion that you\\ntaught me when I was a boy, mother, must tell you that I am right.  You\\nknow it, you feel it.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not know it.  I do not feel it, nor will I ever\\nstand before God’s altar and ask God’s blessing on so hideous a mockery\\nas a marriage between me and George Harford.  I will not say the words\\nthe Church bids us to say.  I will not say them.  I dare not.  How could\\nI swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you\\ndishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin?  No: marriage\\nis a sacrament for those who love each other.  It is not for such as him,\\nor such as me.  Gerald, to save you from the world’s sneers and taunts I\\nhave lied to the world.  For twenty years I have lied to the world.  I\\ncould not tell the world the truth.  Who can, ever?  But not for my own\\nsake will I lie to God, and in God’s presence.  No, Gerald, no ceremony,\\nChurch-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to George Harford.  It\\nmay be that I am too bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left me\\nricher, so that in the mire of my life I found the pearl of price, or\\nwhat I thought would be so.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t understand you now.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Men don’t understand what mothers are.  I am no\\ndifferent from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I\\ndid, and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace.  And yet, to bear\\nyou I had to look on death.  To nurture you I had to wrestle with it.\\nDeath fought with me for you.  All women have to fight with death to keep\\ntheir children.  Death, being childless, wants our children from us.\\nGerald, when you were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave\\nyou food.  Night and day all that long winter I tended you.  No office is\\ntoo mean, no care too lowly for the thing we women love—and oh! how _I_\\nloved _you_.  Not Hannah, Samuel more.  And you needed love, for you were\\nweakly, and only love could have kept you alive.  Only love can keep any\\none alive.  And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain,\\nand we always fancy that when they come to man’s estate and know us\\nbetter they will repay us.  But it is not so.  The world draws them from\\nour side, and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are\\nwith us, and have amusements from which we are barred, and interests that\\nare not ours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life\\nbitter they blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste\\nits sweetness with them . . . You made many friends and went into their\\nhouses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to\\nfollow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat\\nin darkness.  What should I have done in honest households?  My past was\\never with me. . . . And you thought I didn’t care for the pleasant things\\nof life.  I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them,\\nfeeling I had no right.  You thought I was happier working amongst the\\npoor.  That was my mission, you imagined.  It was not, but where else was\\nI to go?  The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is\\npure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the\\nkiss of sin.  It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the\\nlove you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . .\\nAnd you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in\\nChurch duties.  But where else could I turn?  God’s house is the only\\nhouse where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart,\\nGerald, too much in my heart.  For, though day after day, at morn or\\nevensong, I have knelt in God’s house, I have never repented of my sin.\\nHow could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit!  Even now\\nthat you are bitter to me I cannot repent.  I do not.  You are more to me\\nthan innocence.  I would rather be your mother—oh! much rather!—than have\\nbeen always pure . . . Oh, don’t you see? don’t you understand?  It is my\\ndishonour that has made you so dear to me.  It is my disgrace that has\\nbound you so closely to me.  It is the price I paid for you—the price of\\nsoul and body—that makes me love you as I do.  Oh, don’t ask me to do\\nthis horrible thing.  Child of my shame, be still the child of my shame!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I didn’t know you loved me so much as that.  And I will\\nbe a better son to you than I have been.  And you and I must never leave\\neach other . . . but, mother . . . I can’t help it . . . you must become\\nmy father’s wife.  You must marry him.  It is your duty.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Running forwards and embracing_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  No, no; you\\nshall not.  That would be real dishonour, the first you have ever known.\\nThat would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.  Leave him and come\\nwith me.  There are other countries than England . . . Oh! other\\ncountries over sea, better, wiser, and less unjust lands.  The world is\\nvery wide and very big.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No, not for me.  For me the world is shrivelled to a\\npalm’s breadth, and where I walk there are thorns.\\n\\nHESTER.  It shall not be so.  We shall somewhere find green valleys and\\nfresh waters, and if we weep, well, we shall weep together.  Have we not\\nboth loved him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester!\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Waving him back_.]  Don’t, don’t!  You cannot love me at all,\\nunless you love her also.  You cannot honour me, unless she’s holier to\\nyou.  In her all womanhood is martyred.  Not she alone, but all of us are\\nstricken in her house.\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester, Hester, what shall I do?\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you respect the man who is your father?\\n\\nGERALD.  Respect him?  I despise him!  He is infamous.\\n\\nHESTER.  I thank you for saving me from him last night.\\n\\nGERALD.  Ah, that is nothing.  I would die to save you.  But you don’t\\ntell me what to do now!\\n\\nHESTER.  Have I not thanked you for saving _me_?\\n\\nGERALD.  But what should I do?\\n\\nHESTER.  Ask your own heart, not mine.  I never had a mother to save, or\\nshame.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is hard—he is hard.  Let me go away.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Rushes over and kneels down bedside his mother_.]  Mother,\\nforgive me: I have been to blame.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t kiss my hands: they are cold.  My heart is cold:\\nsomething has broken it.\\n\\nHESTER.  Ah, don’t say that.  Hearts live by being wounded.  Pleasure may\\nturn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but sorrow—oh, sorrow\\ncannot break it.  Besides, what sorrows have you now?  Why, at this\\nmoment you are more dear to him than ever, _dear_ though you have _been_,\\nand oh! how dear you _have_ been always.  Ah! be kind to him.\\n\\nGERALD.  You are my mother and my father all in one.  I need no second\\nparent.  It was for you I spoke, for you alone.  Oh, say something,\\nmother.  Have I but found one love to lose another?  Don’t tell me that.\\nO mother, you are cruel.  [_Gets up and flings himself sobbing on a\\nsofa_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_To_ HESTER.]  But has he found indeed another love?\\n\\nHESTER.  You know I have loved him always.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are very poor.\\n\\nHESTER.  Who, being loved, is poor?  Oh, no one.  I hate my riches.  They\\nare a burden.  Let him share it with me.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are disgraced.  We rank among the outcasts Gerald\\nis nameless.  The sins of the parents should be visited on the children.\\nIt is God’s law.\\n\\nHESTER.  I was wrong.  God’s law is only Love.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rises_, _and taking_ HESTER _by the hand_, _goes\\nslowly over to where_ GERALD _is lying on the sofa with his head buried\\nin his hands_.  _She touches him and he looks up_.]  Gerald, I cannot\\ngive you a father, but I have brought you a wife.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  So she comes first, you are worthy.  And when you are\\naway, Gerald . . . with . . . her—oh, think of me sometimes.  Don’t\\nforget me.  And when you pray, pray for me.  We should pray when we are\\nhappiest, and you will be happy, Gerald.\\n\\nHESTER.  Oh, you don’t think of leaving us?\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you won’t leave us?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I might bring shame upon you!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For a little then: and if you let me, near you always.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Come out with us to the garden.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Later on, later on.  [_Exeunt_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT _goes towards door_ L.C.   _Stops at looking-glass over\\nmantelpiece and looks into it_.  _Enter_ ALICE R.C.]\\n\\nALICE.  A gentleman to see you, ma’am.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Say I am not at home.  Show me the card.  [_Takes card\\nfrom salver and looks at it_.]  Say I will not see him.\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _sees him in the glass and\\nstarts_, _but does not turn round_.  _Exit_ ALICE.]  What can you have to\\nsay to me to-day, George Harford?  You can have nothing to say to me.\\nYou must leave this house.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you and me now,\\nso some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three.  I\\nassure you, he will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son may come in at any moment.  I saved you last\\nnight.  I may not be able to save you again.  My son feels my dishonour\\nstrongly, terribly strongly.  I beg you to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sitting down_.]  Last night was excessively\\nunfortunate.  That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I\\nwanted to kiss her.  What harm is there in a kiss?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  A kiss may ruin a human life, George\\nHarford.  _I_ know that.  _I_ know that too well.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  We won’t discuss that at present.  What is of\\nimportance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son.  I am extremely fond\\nof him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired his\\nconduct last night immensely.  He took up the cudgels for that pretty\\nprude with wonderful promptitude.  He is just what I should have liked a\\nson of mine to be.  Except that no son of mine should ever take the side\\nof the Puritans: that is always an error.  Now, what I propose is this.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  According to our ridiculous English laws, I can’t\\nlegitimise Gerald.  But I can leave him my property.  Illingworth is\\nentailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a place.  He can have\\nAshby, which is much prettier, Harborough, which has the best shooting in\\nthe north of England, and the house in St. James Square.  What more can a\\ngentleman require in this world?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing more, I am quite sure.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in\\nthese democratic days.  As George Harford I had everything I wanted.  Now\\nI have merely everything that other people want, which isn’t nearly so\\npleasant.  Well, my proposal is this.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I told you I was not interested, and I beg you to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The boy is to be with you for six months in the year,\\nand with me for the other six.  That is perfectly fair, is it not?  You\\ncan have whatever allowance you like, and live where you choose.  As for\\nyour past, no one knows anything about it except myself and Gerald.\\nThere is the Puritan, of course, the Puritan in white muslin, but she\\ndoesn’t count.  She couldn’t tell the story without explaining that she\\nobjected to being kissed, could she?  And all the women would think her a\\nfool and the men think her a bore.  And you need not be afraid that\\nGerald won’t be my heir.  I needn’t tell you I have not the slightest\\nintention of marrying.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You come too late.  My son has no need of you.  You are\\nnot necessary.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you mean, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That you are not necessary to Gerald’s career.  He does\\nnot require you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do not understand you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Look into the garden.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _rises and goes\\ntowards window_.]  You had better not let them see you: you bring\\nunpleasant memories.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _looks out and starts_.]  She\\nloves him.  They love each other.  We are safe from you, and we are going\\naway.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Where?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  We will not tell you, and if you find us we will not\\nknow you.  You seem surprised.  What welcome would you get from the girl\\nwhose lips you tried to soil, from the boy whose life you have shamed,\\nfrom the mother whose dishonour comes from you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You have grown hard, Rachel.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I was too weak once.  It is well for me that I have\\nchanged.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was very young at the time.  We men know life too\\nearly.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  And we women know life too late.  That is the difference\\nbetween men and women.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, I want my son.  My money may be of no use to\\nhim now.  I may be of no use to him, but I want my son.  Bring us\\ntogether, Rachel.  You can do it if you choose.  [_Sees letter on\\ntable_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is no room in my boy’s life for you.  He is not\\ninterested in _you_.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then why does he write to me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What do you mean?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What letter is this?  [_Takes up letter_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That—is nothing.  Give it to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is addressed to _me_.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are not to open it.  I forbid you to open it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And in Gerald’s handwriting.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not to have been sent.  It is a letter he wrote\\nto you this morning, before he saw me.  But he is sorry now he wrote it,\\nvery sorry.  You are not to open it.  Give it to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It belongs to me.  [_Opens it_, _sits down and reads\\nit slowly_. MRS. ARBUTHNOT _watches him all the time_.]  You have read\\nthis letter, I suppose, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You know what is in it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t admit for a moment that the boy is right in\\nwhat he says.  I don’t admit that it is any duty of mine to marry you.  I\\ndeny it entirely.  But to get my son back I am ready—yes, I am ready to\\nmarry you, Rachel—and to treat you always with the deference and respect\\ndue to my wife.  I will marry you as soon as you choose.  I give you my\\nword of honour.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You made that promise to me once before and broke it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I will keep it now.  And that will show you that I\\nlove my son, at least as much as you love him.  For when I marry you,\\nRachel, there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender.  High\\nambitions, too, if any ambition is high.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I decline to marry you, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you serious?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do tell me your reasons.  They would interest me\\nenormously.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have already explained them to my son.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose they were intensely sentimental, weren’t\\nthey?  You women live by your emotions and for them.  You have no\\nphilosophy of life.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are right.  We women live by our emotions and for\\nthem.  By our passions, and for them, if you will.  I have two passions,\\nLord Illingworth: my love of him, my hate of you.  You cannot kill those.\\nThey feed each other.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What sort of love is that which needs to have hate as\\nits brother?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is the sort of love I have for Gerald.  Do you think\\nthat terrible?  Well it is terrible.  All love is terrible.  All love is\\na tragedy.  I loved you once, Lord Illingworth.  Oh, what a tragedy for a\\nwoman to have loved you!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So you really refuse to marry me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Because you hate me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And does my son hate me as you do?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am glad of that, Rachel.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He merely despises you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a pity!  What a pity for him, I mean.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t be deceived, George.  Children begin by loving\\ntheir parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely if ever do they\\nforgive them.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Reads letter over again_, _very slowly_.]  May I ask\\nby what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter, this beautiful,\\npassionate letter, believe that you should not marry his father, the\\nfather of your own child?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not I who made him see it.  It was another.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What _fin-de-siècle_ person?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The Puritan, Lord Illingworth.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces_, _then rises slowly and goes over to table\\nwhere his hat and gloves are_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is standing close to the\\ntable_.  _He picks up one of the gloves, and begins pulling it on_.]\\nThere is not much then for me to do here, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is good-bye, is it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For ever, I hope, this time, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How curious!  At this moment you look exactly as you\\nlooked the night you left me twenty years ago.  You have just the same\\nexpression in your mouth.  Upon my word, Rachel, no woman ever loved me\\nas you did.  Why, you gave yourself to me like a flower, to do anything I\\nliked with.  You were the prettiest of playthings, the most fascinating\\nof small romances . . . [_Pulls out watch_.]  Quarter to two!  Must be\\nstrolling back to Hunstanton.  Don’t suppose I shall see you there again.\\nI’m sorry, I am, really.  It’s been an amusing experience to have met\\namongst people of one’s own rank, and treated quite seriously too, one’s\\nmistress, and one’s—\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _snatches up glove and strikes_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _across\\nthe face with it_.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _starts_.  _He is dazed by the\\ninsult of his punishment_.  _Then he controls himself_, _and goes to\\nwindow and looks out at his son_.  _Sighs and leaves the room_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Falls sobbing on the sofa_.]  He would have said it.\\nHe would have said it.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ HESTER _from the garden_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother.  You never came out after all.  So we have\\ncome in to fetch you.  Mother, you have not been crying?  [_Kneels down\\nbeside her_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My boy!  My boy!  My boy!  [_Running her fingers through\\nhis hair_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Coming over_.]  But you have two children now.  You’ll let me\\nbe your daughter?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Looking up_.]  Would you choose me for a mother?\\n\\nHESTER.  You of all women I have ever known.\\n\\n[_They move towards the door leading into garden with their arms round\\neach other’s waists_.  GERALD _goes to table_ L.C. _for his hat_.  _On\\nturning round he sees_ LORD ILLINGWORTH’S _glove lying on the floor_,\\n_and picks it up_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Hallo, mother, whose glove is this?  You have had a visitor.\\nWho was it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  Oh! no one.

He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes\\nhe had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\\nsword-hilt.\\n\\nHe was very much admired indeed.  “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,”\\nremarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for\\nhaving artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing\\nlest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\\n\\n“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of her\\nlittle boy who was crying for the moon.  “The Happy Prince never dreams\\nof crying for anything.”\\n\\n“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a\\ndisappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\\n\\n“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out\\nof the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white\\npinafores.\\n\\n“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen\\none.”\\n\\n“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the\\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not\\napprove of children dreaming.\\n\\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had\\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was\\nin love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring\\nas he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so\\nattracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\\n\\n“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at\\nonce, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her,\\ntouching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was\\nhis courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\\n\\n“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has\\nno money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite\\nfull of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\\n\\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.\\n“She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a\\ncoquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.”  And certainly,\\nwhenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  “I\\nadmit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my\\nwife, consequently, should love travelling also.”\\n\\n“Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook\\nher head, she was so attached to her home.\\n\\n“You have been trifling with me,” he cried.  “I am off to the Pyramids.\\nGood-bye!” and he flew away.\\n\\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  “Where\\nshall I put up?” he said; “I hope the town has made preparations.”\\n\\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\\n\\n“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of\\nfresh air.”  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\\n\\n“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round,\\nand he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under\\nhis wing a large drop of water fell on him.  “What a curious thing!” he\\ncried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear\\nand bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is\\nreally dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her\\nselfishness.”\\n\\nThen another drop fell.\\n\\n“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I\\nmust look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.\\n\\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up,\\nand saw—Ah! what did he see?\\n\\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were\\nrunning down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the\\nmoonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\\n\\n“Who are you?” he said.\\n\\n“I am the Happy Prince.”\\n\\n“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched\\nme.”\\n\\n“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not\\nknow what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where\\nsorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my\\ncompanions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great\\nHall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask\\nwhat lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers\\ncalled me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be\\nhappiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have\\nset me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery\\nof my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but\\nweep.”\\n\\n“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow to himself.  He was too\\npolite to make any personal remarks out loud.\\n\\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a\\nlittle street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and\\nthrough it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and\\nworn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she\\nis a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for\\nthe loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next\\nCourt-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying\\nill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing\\nto give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little\\nSwallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet\\nare fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.”\\n\\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow.  “My friends are flying up\\nand down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they\\nwill go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there\\nhimself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and\\nembalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and\\nhis hands are like withered leaves.”\\n\\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\\nwith me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and\\nthe mother so sad.”\\n\\n“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow.  “Last summer, when I\\nwas staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons,\\nwho were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we\\nswallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family\\nfamous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”\\n\\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.\\n“It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night,\\nand be your messenger.”\\n\\n“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.\\n\\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and\\nflew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\\n\\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were\\nsculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A\\nbeautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  “How wonderful\\nthe stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love!”\\n\\n“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered;\\n“I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the\\nseamstresses are so lazy.”\\n\\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of\\nthe ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining\\nwith each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he\\ncame to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on\\nhis bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he\\nhopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble.\\nThen he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his\\nwings.  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and\\nhe sank into a delicious slumber.\\n\\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had\\ndone.  “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although\\nit is so cold.”\\n\\n“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince.  And the\\nlittle Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always\\nmade him sleepy.\\n\\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  “What a\\nremarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was\\npassing over the bridge.  “A swallow in winter!”  And he wrote a long\\nletter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full\\nof so many words that they could not understand.\\n\\n“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at\\nthe prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time\\non top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped,\\nand said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed\\nhimself very much.\\n\\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  “Have you any\\ncommissions for Egypt?” he cried; “I am just starting.”\\n\\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\\nwith me one night longer?”\\n\\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow.  “To-morrow my friends\\nwill fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among\\nthe bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All\\nnight long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he\\nutters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions\\ncome down to the water’s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green\\nberyls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.”\\n\\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the\\ncity I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered\\nwith papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered\\nviolets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a\\npomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a\\nplay for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any\\nmore.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”\\n\\n“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had\\na good heart.  “Shall I take him another ruby?”\\n\\n“Alas!  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I\\nhave left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of\\nIndia a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.\\nHe will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish\\nhis play.”\\n\\n“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to\\nweep.\\n\\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\\nyou.”\\n\\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the\\nstudent’s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in\\nthe roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man\\nhad his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the\\nbird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying\\non the withered violets.\\n\\n“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great\\nadmirer.  Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.\\n\\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of\\na large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold\\nwith ropes.  “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up.  “I am\\ngoing to Egypt”! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon\\nrose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\\n\\n“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.\\n\\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay\\nwith me one night longer?”\\n\\n“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be\\nhere.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the\\ncrocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are\\nbuilding a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves\\nare watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave\\nyou, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back\\ntwo beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby\\nshall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the\\ngreat sea.”\\n\\n“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little\\nmatch-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all\\nspoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,\\nand she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is\\nbare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will\\nnot beat her.”\\n\\n“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot\\npluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.”\\n\\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command\\nyou.”\\n\\nSo he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it.  He\\nswooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her\\nhand.  “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran\\nhome, laughing.\\n\\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince.  “You are blind now,” he said,\\n“so I will stay with you always.”\\n\\n“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.”\\n\\n“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the\\nPrince’s feet.\\n\\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of\\nwhat he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who\\nstand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their\\nbeaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the\\ndesert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the\\nside of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King\\nof the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a\\nlarge crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and\\nhas twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who\\nsail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the\\nbutterflies.\\n\\n“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous\\nthings, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of\\nwomen.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little\\nSwallow, and tell me what you see there.”\\n\\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in\\ntheir beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He\\nflew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children\\nlooking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a\\nbridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep\\nthemselves warm.  “How hungry we are!” they said.  “You must not lie\\nhere,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\\n\\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\\n\\n“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off,\\nleaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold\\ncan make them happy.”\\n\\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy\\nPrince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he\\nbrought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they\\nlaughed and played games in the street.  “We have bread now!” they cried.\\n\\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets\\nlooked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and\\nglistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of\\nthe houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore\\nscarlet caps and skated on the ice.\\n\\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave\\nthe Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the\\nbaker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself\\nwarm by flapping his wings.\\n\\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to\\nfly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more.  “Good-bye, dear Prince!” he\\nmurmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?”\\n\\n“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the\\nPrince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips,\\nfor I love you.”\\n\\n“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow.  “I am going to\\nthe House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?”\\n\\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his\\nfeet.\\n\\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something\\nhad broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.\\nIt certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\\n\\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in\\ncompany with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked\\nup at the statue: “Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!” he said.\\n\\n“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with\\nthe Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\\n\\n“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is\\ngolden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle better than a\\nbeggar!”\\n\\n“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors.\\n\\n“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!” continued the Mayor.  “We\\nmust really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die\\nhere.”  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\\n\\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  “As he is no longer\\nbeautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the\\nUniversity.\\n\\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of\\nthe Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  “We must\\nhave another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of\\nmyself.”\\n\\n“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.\\nWhen I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\\n\\n“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.\\n“This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it\\naway.”  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also\\nlying.\\n\\n“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of\\nHis Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\\n\\n“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this\\nlittle bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy\\nPrince shall praise me.”\\n\\n                [Picture: Decorative graphic of two birds]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Nightingale and the Rose.\\n\\n\\n        [Picture: Decorative graphic of young man lying on grass]\\n\\n“SHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,” cried\\nthe young Student; “but in all my garden there is no red rose.”\\n\\nFrom her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she\\nlooked out through the leaves, and wondered.\\n\\n“No red rose in all my garden!” he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled\\nwith tears.  “Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!  I have\\nread all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of\\nphilosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made\\nwretched.”\\n\\n“Here at last is a true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “Night after night\\nhave I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told\\nhis story to the stars, and now I see him.  His hair is dark as the\\nhyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but\\npassion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal\\nupon his brow.”\\n\\n“The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,” murmured the young Student,\\n“and my love will be of the company.  If I bring her a red rose she will\\ndance with me till dawn.  If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in\\nmy arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will\\nbe clasped in mine.  But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall\\nsit lonely, and she will pass me by.  She will have no heed of me, and my\\nheart will break.”\\n\\n“Here indeed is the true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “What I sing of,\\nhe suffers—what is joy to me, to him is pain.  Surely Love is a wonderful\\nthing.  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.\\nPearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the\\nmarketplace.  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be\\nweighed out in the balance for gold.”\\n\\n“The musicians will sit in their gallery,” said the young Student, “and\\nplay upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound\\nof the harp and the violin.  She will dance so lightly that her feet will\\nnot touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng\\nround her.  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to\\ngive her”; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in\\nhis hands, and wept.\\n\\n“Why is he weeping?” asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with\\nhis tail in the air.\\n\\n“Why, indeed?” said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a\\nsunbeam.\\n\\n“Why, indeed?” whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.\\n\\n“He is weeping for a red rose,” said the Nightingale.\\n\\n“For a red rose?” they cried; “how very ridiculous!” and the little\\nLizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.\\n\\nBut the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student’s sorrow, and\\nshe sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.\\n\\nSuddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.\\nShe passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed\\nacross the garden.\\n\\nIn the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and\\nwhen she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.\\n\\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\\n\\nBut the Tree shook its head.\\n\\n“My roses are white,” it answered; “as white as the foam of the sea, and\\nwhiter than the snow upon the mountain.  But go to my brother who grows\\nround the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.”\\n\\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the\\nold sun-dial.\\n\\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\\n\\nBut the Tree shook its head.\\n\\n“My roses are yellow,” it answered; “as yellow as the hair of the\\nmermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil\\nthat blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.  But go\\nto my brother who grows beneath the Student’s window, and perhaps he will\\ngive you what you want.”\\n\\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath\\nthe Student’s window.\\n\\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\\n\\nBut the Tree shook its head.\\n\\n“My roses are red,” it answered, “as red as the feet of the dove, and\\nredder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the\\nocean-cavern.  But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has\\nnipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no\\nroses at all this year.”\\n\\n“One red rose is all I want,” cried the Nightingale, “only one red rose!\\nIs there no way by which I can get it?”\\n\\n“There is a way,” answered the Tree; “but it is so terrible that I dare\\nnot tell it to you.”\\n\\n“Tell it to me,” said the Nightingale, “I am not afraid.”\\n\\n“If you want a red rose,” said the Tree, “you must build it out of music\\nby moonlight, and stain it with your own heart’s-blood.  You must sing to\\nme with your breast against a thorn.  All night long you must sing to me,\\nand the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into\\nmy veins, and become mine.”\\n\\n“Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,” cried the Nightingale,\\n“and Life is very dear to all.  It is pleasant to sit in the green wood,\\nand to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot\\nof pearl.  Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the\\nbluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the\\nhill.  Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird\\ncompared to the heart of a man?”\\n\\nSo she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.  She\\nswept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through\\nthe grove.\\n\\nThe young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him,\\nand the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.\\n\\n“Be happy,” cried the Nightingale, “be happy; you shall have your red\\nrose.  I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my\\nown heart’s-blood.  All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a\\ntrue lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and\\nmightier than Power, though he is mighty.  Flame-coloured are his wings,\\nand coloured like flame is his body.  His lips are sweet as honey, and\\nhis breath is like frankincense.”\\n\\nThe Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not\\nunderstand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the\\nthings that are written down in books.\\n\\nBut the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the\\nlittle Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.\\n\\n“Sing me one last song,” he whispered; “I shall feel very lonely when you\\nare gone.”\\n\\nSo the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water\\nbubbling from a silver jar.\\n\\nWhen she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book\\nand a lead-pencil out of his pocket.\\n\\n“She has form,” he said to himself, as he walked away through the\\ngrove—“that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?  I am\\nafraid not.  In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without\\nany sincerity.  She would not sacrifice herself for others.  She thinks\\nmerely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.  Still,\\nit must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.  What\\na pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.”\\nAnd he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and\\nbegan to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.\\n\\nAnd when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the\\nRose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.  All night long she sang\\nwith her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down\\nand listened.  All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and\\ndeeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.\\n\\nShe sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.\\nAnd on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous\\nrose, petal following petal, as song followed song.  Pale was it, at\\nfirst, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the\\nmorning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.  As the shadow of a rose in\\na mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the\\nrose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.\\n\\nBut the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\\n“Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come\\nbefore the rose is finished.”\\n\\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and\\nlouder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of\\na man and a maid.\\n\\nAnd a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the\\nflush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.\\nBut the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose’s heart remained\\nwhite, for only a Nightingale’s heart’s-blood can crimson the heart of a\\nrose.\\n\\nAnd the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.\\n“Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come\\nbefore the rose is finished.”\\n\\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn\\ntouched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.  Bitter,\\nbitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of\\nthe Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the\\ntomb.\\n\\nAnd the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.\\nCrimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.\\n\\nBut the Nightingale’s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to\\nbeat, and a film came over her eyes.  Fainter and fainter grew her song,\\nand she felt something choking her in her throat.\\n\\nThen she gave one last burst of music.  The white Moon heard it, and she\\nforgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.  The red rose heard it, and\\nit trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold\\nmorning air.  Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke\\nthe sleeping shepherds from their dreams.  It floated through the reeds\\nof the river, and they carried its message to the sea.\\n\\n“Look, look!” cried the Tree, “the rose is finished now”; but the\\nNightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass,\\nwith the thorn in her heart.\\n\\nAnd at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.\\n\\n“Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!” he cried; “here is a red rose!  I\\nhave never seen any rose like it in all my life.  It is so beautiful that\\nI am sure it has a long Latin name”; and he leaned down and plucked it.\\n\\nThen he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor’s house with the rose\\nin his hand.\\n\\nThe daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue\\nsilk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.\\n\\n“You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,”\\ncried the Student.  “Here is the reddest rose in all the world.  You will\\nwear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell\\nyou how I love you.”\\n\\nBut the girl frowned.\\n\\n“I am afraid it will not go with my dress,” she answered; “and, besides,\\nthe Chamberlain’s nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody\\nknows that jewels cost far more than flowers.”\\n\\n“Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,” said the Student angrily;\\nand he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and\\na cart-wheel went over it.\\n\\n“Ungrateful!” said the girl.  “I tell you what, you are very rude; and,\\nafter all, who are you?  Only a Student.  Why, I don’t believe you have\\neven got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain’s nephew has”;\\nand she got up from her chair and went into the house.\\n\\n“What a silly thing Love is,” said the Student as he walked away.  “It\\nis not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is\\nalways telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one\\nbelieve things that are not true.  In fact, it is quite unpractical, and,\\nas in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to\\nPhilosophy and study Metaphysics.”\\n\\nSo he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began\\nto read.\\n\\n          [Picture: Decorative graphic of nightingale and rose]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Selfish Giant.\\n\\n\\n                       [Picture: The Selfish Giant]\\n\\nEVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go\\nand play in the Giant’s garden.\\n\\nIt was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass.  Here and there over\\nthe grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve\\npeach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of\\npink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit.  The birds sat on the\\ntrees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in\\norder to listen to them.  “How happy we are here!” they cried to each\\nother.\\n\\n           [Picture: Decorative graphic of children in garden]\\n\\nOne day the Giant came back.  He had been to visit his friend the Cornish\\nogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.  After the seven years\\nwere over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was\\nlimited, and he determined to return to his own castle.  When he arrived\\nhe saw the children playing in the garden.\\n\\n“What are you doing here?” he cried in a very gruff voice, and the\\nchildren ran away.\\n\\n“My own garden is my own garden,” said the Giant; “any one can understand\\nthat, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.”  So he built a\\nhigh wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.\\n\\n          TRESPASSERS\\n\\n            WILL BE\\n\\n           PROSECUTED\\n\\nHe was a very selfish Giant.\\n\\nThe poor children had now nowhere to play.  They tried to play on the\\nroad, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did\\nnot like it.  They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons\\nwere over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.  “How happy we\\nwere there,” they said to each other.\\n\\nThen the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms\\nand little birds.  Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still\\nwinter.  The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children,\\nand the trees forgot to blossom.  Once a beautiful flower put its head\\nout from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for\\nthe children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to\\nsleep.  The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost.\\n“Spring has forgotten this garden,” they cried, “so we will live here all\\nthe year round.”  The Snow covered up the grass with her great white\\ncloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver.  Then they invited the\\nNorth Wind to stay with them, and he came.  He was wrapped in furs, and\\nhe roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down.\\n“This is a delightful spot,” he said, “we must ask the Hail on a visit.”\\nSo the Hail came.  Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of\\nthe castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and\\nround the garden as fast as he could go.  He was dressed in grey, and his\\nbreath was like ice.\\n\\n“I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,” said the\\nSelfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white\\ngarden; “I hope there will be a change in the weather.”\\n\\nBut the Spring never came, nor the Summer.  The Autumn gave golden fruit\\nto every garden, but to the Giant’s garden she gave none.  “He is too\\nselfish,” she said.  So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind,\\nand the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.\\n\\nOne morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely\\nmusic.  It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the\\nKing’s musicians passing by.  It was really only a little linnet singing\\noutside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in\\nhis garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the\\nworld.  Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind\\nceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open\\ncasement.  “I believe the Spring has come at last,” said the Giant; and\\nhe jumped out of bed and looked out.\\n\\nWhat did he see?\\n\\nHe saw a most wonderful sight.  Through a little hole in the wall the\\nchildren had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the\\ntrees.  In every tree that he could see there was a little child.  And\\nthe trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had\\ncovered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above\\nthe children’s heads.  The birds were flying about and twittering with\\ndelight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and\\nlaughing.  It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.\\nIt was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little\\nboy.  He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the\\ntree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.  The poor tree\\nwas still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was\\nblowing and roaring above it.  “Climb up! little boy,” said the Tree, and\\nit bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.\\n\\nAnd the Giant’s heart melted as he looked out.  “How selfish I have\\nbeen!” he said; “now I know why the Spring would not come here.  I will\\nput that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock\\ndown the wall, and my garden shall be the children’s playground for ever\\nand ever.”  He was really very sorry for what he had done.\\n\\nSo he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went\\nout into the garden.  But when the children saw him they were so\\nfrightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.\\nOnly the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that\\nhe did not see the Giant coming.  And the Giant stole up behind him and\\ntook him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.  And the tree\\nbroke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the\\nlittle boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant’s\\nneck, and kissed him.  And the other children, when they saw that the\\nGiant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came\\nthe Spring.  “It is your garden now, little children,” said the Giant,\\nand he took a great axe and knocked down the wall.  And when the people\\nwere going to market at twelve o’clock they found the Giant playing with\\nthe children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.\\n\\nAll day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to\\nbid him good-bye.\\n\\n“But where is your little companion?” he said: “the boy I put into the\\ntree.”  The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.\\n\\n“We don’t know,” answered the children; “he has gone away.”\\n\\n“You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,” said the Giant.\\nBut the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had\\nnever seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.\\n\\nEvery afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with\\nthe Giant.  But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.\\nThe Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first\\nlittle friend, and often spoke of him.  “How I would like to see him!” he\\nused to say.\\n\\nYears went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble.  He could not\\nplay about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the\\nchildren at their games, and admired his garden.  “I have many beautiful\\nflowers,” he said; “but the children are the most beautiful flowers of\\nall.”\\n\\nOne winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing.  He\\ndid not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring\\nasleep, and that the flowers were resting.\\n\\nSuddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked.  It\\ncertainly was a marvellous sight.  In the farthest corner of the garden\\nwas a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.  Its branches were\\nall golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood\\nthe little boy he had loved.\\n\\nDownstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden.  He\\nhastened across the grass, and came near to the child.  And when he came\\nquite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, “Who hath dared to\\nwound thee?”  For on the palms of the child’s hands were the prints of\\ntwo nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.\\n\\n“Who hath dared to wound thee?” cried the Giant; “tell me, that I may\\ntake my big sword and slay him.”\\n\\n“Nay!” answered the child; “but these are the wounds of Love.”\\n\\n“Who art thou?” said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he\\nknelt before the little child.\\n\\nAnd the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, “You let me play once\\nin your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is\\nParadise.”\\n\\nAnd when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying\\ndead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.\\n\\n                 [Picture: Decorative graphic of wreath]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Devoted Friend.\\n\\n\\n                      [Picture: Hans and the Miller]\\n\\nONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.  He had\\nbright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long\\nbit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the\\npond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who\\nwas pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand\\non their heads in the water.\\n\\n“You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your\\nheads,” she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them\\nhow it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They\\nwere so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in\\nsociety at all.\\n\\n“What disobedient children!” cried the old Water-rat; “they really\\ndeserve to be drowned.”\\n\\n“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, “every one must make a\\nbeginning, and parents cannot be too patient.”\\n\\n“Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,” said the Water-rat;\\n“I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never\\nintend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much\\nhigher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or\\nrarer than a devoted friendship.”\\n\\n“And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?” asked a\\nGreen Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard\\nthe conversation.\\n\\n“Yes, that is just what I want to know,” said the Duck; and she swam away\\nto the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her\\nchildren a good example.\\n\\n“What a silly question!” cried the Water-rat.  “I should expect my\\ndevoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.”\\n\\n“And what would you do in return?” said the little bird, swinging upon a\\nsilver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\\n\\n“I don’t understand you,” answered the Water-rat.\\n\\n“Let me tell you a story on the subject,” said the Linnet.\\n\\n“Is the story about me?” asked the Water-rat.  “If so, I will listen to\\nit, for I am extremely fond of fiction.”\\n\\n“It is applicable to you,” answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and\\nalighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\\n\\n“Once upon a time,” said the Linnet, “there was an honest little fellow\\nnamed Hans.”\\n\\n“Was he very distinguished?” asked the Water-rat.\\n\\n“No,” answered the Linnet, “I don’t think he was distinguished at all,\\nexcept for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He\\nlived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his\\ngarden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.\\nSweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds’-purses, and\\nFair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac\\nCrocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock,\\nMarjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil\\nand the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the\\nmonths went by, one flower taking another flower’s place, so that there\\nwere always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\\n\\n“Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all\\nwas big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to\\nlittle Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over\\nthe wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or\\nfilling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\\n\\n“‘Real friends should have everything in common,’ the Miller used to say,\\nand little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend\\nwith such noble ideas.\\n\\n“Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich\\nMiller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred\\nsacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large\\nflock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these\\nthings, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the\\nwonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true\\nfriendship.\\n\\n“So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the\\nsummer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and\\nhe had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good\\ndeal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper\\nbut a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was\\nextremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\\n\\n“‘There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow\\nlasts,’ the Miller used to say to his wife, ‘for when people are in\\ntrouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That\\nat least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I\\nshall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and\\nhe will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make\\nhim so happy.’\\n\\n“‘You are certainly very thoughtful about others,’ answered the Wife, as\\nshe sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ‘very\\nthoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about\\nfriendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful\\nthings as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear\\na gold ring on his little finger.’\\n\\n“‘But could we not ask little Hans up here?’ said the Miller’s youngest\\nson.  ‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and\\nshow him my white rabbits.’\\n\\n“‘What a silly boy you are!’ cried the Miller; ‘I really don’t know what\\nis the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything.\\nWhy, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good\\nsupper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is\\na most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature.  I certainly\\nwill not allow Hans’ nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I\\nwill always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any\\ntemptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have\\nsome flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and\\nfriendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words\\nare spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can\\nsee that.’\\n\\n“‘How well you talk!’ said the Miller’s Wife, pouring herself out a large\\nglass of warm ale; ‘really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in\\nchurch.’\\n\\n“‘Lots of people act well,’ answered the Miller; ‘but very few people\\ntalk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of\\nthe two, and much the finer thing also’; and he looked sternly across the\\ntable at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his\\nhead down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.\\nHowever, he was so young that you must excuse him.”\\n\\n“Is that the end of the story?” asked the Water-rat.\\n\\n“Certainly not,” answered the Linnet, “that is the beginning.”\\n\\n“Then you are quite behind the age,” said the Water-rat.  “Every good\\nstory-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the\\nbeginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I\\nheard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the\\npond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am\\nsure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head,\\nand whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh!’\\nBut pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all\\nkinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy\\nbetween us.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as\\nsoon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale\\nyellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see\\nlittle Hans.\\n\\n“‘Why, what a good heart you have!’ cried his Wife; ‘you are always\\nthinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the\\nflowers.’\\n\\n“So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron\\nchain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\\n\\n“‘Good morning, little Hans,’ said the Miller.\\n\\n“‘Good morning,’ said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to\\near.\\n\\n“‘And how have you been all the winter?’ said the Miller.\\n\\n“‘Well, really,’ cried Hans, ‘it is very good of you to ask, very good\\nindeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring\\nhas come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.’\\n\\n“‘We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘and\\nwondered how you were getting on.’\\n\\n“‘That was kind of you,’ said Hans; ‘I was half afraid you had forgotten\\nme.’\\n\\n“‘Hans, I am surprised at you,’ said the Miller; ‘friendship never\\nforgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don’t\\nunderstand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking,\\nby-the-bye!”\\n\\n“‘They are certainly very lovely,’ said Hans, ‘and it is a most lucky\\nthing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the\\nmarket and sell them to the Burgomaster’s daughter, and buy back my\\nwheelbarrow with the money.’\\n\\n“‘Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don’t mean to say you have sold it?\\nWhat a very stupid thing to do!’\\n\\n“‘Well, the fact is,’ said Hans, ‘that I was obliged to.  You see the\\nwinter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to\\nbuy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,\\nand then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last\\nI sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.’\\n\\n“‘Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in\\nvery good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong\\nwith the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I\\nknow it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me\\nextremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the\\nworld.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,\\nbesides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your\\nmind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.’\\n\\n“‘Well, really, that is generous of you,’ said little Hans, and his funny\\nround face glowed all over with pleasure.  ‘I can easily put it in\\nrepair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.’\\n\\n“‘A plank of wood!’ said the Miller; ‘why, that is just what I want for\\nthe roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will\\nall get damp if I don’t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is\\nquite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given\\nyou my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of\\ncourse, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,\\nfriendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I\\nwill set to work at my barn this very day.’\\n\\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the\\nplank out.\\n\\n“‘It is not a very big plank,’ said the Miller, looking at it, ‘and I am\\nafraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won’t be any left for\\nyou to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault.\\nAnd now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to\\ngive me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it\\nquite full.’\\n\\n“‘Quite full?’ said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a\\nvery big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no\\nflowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver\\nbuttons back.\\n\\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘as I have given you my\\nwheelbarrow, I don’t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.\\nI may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true\\nfriendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.’\\n\\n“‘My dear friend, my best friend,’ cried little Hans, ‘you are welcome to\\nall the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion\\nthan my silver buttons, any day’; and he ran and plucked all his pretty\\nprimroses, and filled the Miller’s basket.\\n\\n“‘Good-bye, little Hans,’ said the Miller, as he went up the hill with\\nthe plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\\n\\n“‘Good-bye,’ said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he\\nwas so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\\n\\n“The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when\\nhe heard the Miller’s voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped\\noff the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\\n\\n“There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\\n\\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ said the Miller, ‘would you mind carrying this sack\\nof flour for me to market?’\\n\\n“‘Oh, I am so sorry,’ said Hans, ‘but I am really very busy to-day.  I\\nhave got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all\\nmy grass to roll.’\\n\\n“‘Well, really,’ said the Miller, ‘I think that, considering that I am\\ngoing to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to\\nrefuse.’\\n\\n“‘Oh, don’t say that,’ cried little Hans, ‘I wouldn’t be unfriendly for\\nthe whole world’; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big\\nsack on his shoulders.\\n\\n“It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans\\nhad reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down\\nand rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the\\nmarket.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour\\nfor a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was\\nafraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\\n\\n“‘It has certainly been a hard day,’ said little Hans to himself as he\\nwas going to bed, ‘but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is\\nmy best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.’\\n\\n“Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his\\nsack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\\n\\n“‘Upon my word,’ said the Miller, ‘you are very lazy.  Really,\\nconsidering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might\\nwork harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don’t like any of\\nmy friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite\\nplainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not\\nyour friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say\\nexactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to\\nplease and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,\\nand does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he\\nprefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.’\\n\\n“‘I am very sorry,’ said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off\\nhis night-cap, ‘but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for\\na little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I\\nalways work better after hearing the birds sing?’\\n\\n“‘Well, I am glad of that,’ said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the\\nback, ‘for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed,\\nand mend my barn-roof for me.’\\n\\n“Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his\\nflowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse\\nthe Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\\n\\n“‘Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?’ he\\ninquired in a shy and timid voice.\\n\\n“‘Well, really,’ answered the Miller, ‘I do not think it is much to ask\\nof you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of\\ncourse if you refuse I will go and do it myself.’\\n\\n“‘Oh! on no account,’ cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and\\ndressed himself, and went up to the barn.\\n\\n“He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came\\nto see how he was getting on.\\n\\n“‘Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?’ cried the\\nMiller in a cheery voice.\\n\\n“‘It is quite mended,’ answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\\n\\n“‘Ah!’ said the Miller, ‘there is no work so delightful as the work one\\ndoes for others.’\\n\\n“‘It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,’ answered little\\nHans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ‘a very great privilege.\\nBut I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.’\\n\\n“‘Oh! they will come to you,’ said the Miller, ‘but you must take more\\npains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you\\nwill have the theory also.’\\n\\n“‘Do you really think I shall?’ asked little Hans.\\n\\n“‘I have no doubt of it,’ answered the Miller, ‘but now that you have\\nmended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive\\nmy sheep to the mountain to-morrow.’\\n\\n“Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next\\nmorning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans\\nstarted off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get\\nthere and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to\\nsleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\\n\\n“‘What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,’ he said, and he went\\nto work at once.\\n\\n“But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his\\nfriend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long\\nerrands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much\\ndistressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had\\nforgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller\\nwas his best friend.  ‘Besides,’ he used to say, ‘he is going to give me\\nhis wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.’\\n\\n“So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds\\nof beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a\\nnote-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good\\nscholar.\\n\\n“Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside\\nwhen a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind\\nwas blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he\\nthought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a\\nthird, louder than any of the others.\\n\\n“‘It is some poor traveller,’ said little Hans to himself, and he ran to\\nthe door.\\n\\n“There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the\\nother.\\n\\n“‘Dear little Hans,’ cried the Miller, ‘I am in great trouble.  My little\\nboy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the\\nDoctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it\\nhas just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead\\nof me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is\\nonly fair that you should do something for me in return.’\\n\\n“‘Certainly,’ cried little Hans, ‘I take it quite as a compliment your\\ncoming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your\\nlantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the\\nditch.’\\n\\n“‘I am very sorry,’ answered the Miller, ‘but it is my new lantern, and\\nit would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.’\\n\\n“‘Well, never mind, I will do without it,’ cried little Hans, and he took\\ndown his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler\\nround his throat, and started off.\\n\\n“What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans\\ncould hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely\\nstand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking\\nabout three hours, he arrived at the Doctor’s house, and knocked at the\\ndoor.\\n\\n“‘Who is there?’ cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom\\nwindow.\\n\\n“‘Little Hans, Doctor.’\\n\\n“’What do you want, little Hans?’\\n\\n“‘The Miller’s son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and\\nthe Miller wants you to come at once.’\\n\\n“‘All right!’ said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big\\nboots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the\\ndirection of the Miller’s house, little Hans trudging behind him.\\n\\n“But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and\\nlittle Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.\\nAt last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very\\ndangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans\\nwas drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating\\nin a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\\n\\n“Everybody went to little Hans’ funeral, as he was so popular, and the\\nMiller was the chief mourner.\\n\\n“‘As I was his best friend,’ said the Miller, ‘it is only fair that I\\nshould have the best place’; so he walked at the head of the procession\\nin a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a\\nbig pocket-handkerchief.\\n\\n“‘Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,’ said the\\nBlacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated\\ncomfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\\n\\n“‘A great loss to me at any rate,’ answered the Miller; ‘why, I had as\\ngood as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don’t know what to do\\nwith it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair\\nthat I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take\\ncare not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being\\ngenerous.’”\\n\\n“Well?” said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\\n\\n“Well, that is the end,” said the Linnet.\\n\\n“But what became of the Miller?” asked the Water-rat.\\n\\n“Oh!  I really don’t know,” replied the Linnet; “and I am sure that I\\ndon’t care.”\\n\\n“It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,” said\\nthe Water-rat.\\n\\n“I am afraid you don’t quite see the moral of the story,” remarked the\\nLinnet.\\n\\n“The what?” screamed the Water-rat.\\n\\n“The moral.”\\n\\n“Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” said the Linnet.\\n\\n“Well, really,” said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, “I think you\\nshould have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I\\ncertainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said\\n‘Pooh,’ like the critic.  However, I can say it now”; so he shouted out\\n“Pooh” at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back\\ninto his hole.\\n\\n“And how do you like the Water-rat?” asked the Duck, who came paddling up\\nsome minutes afterwards.  “He has a great many good points, but for my\\nown part I have a mother’s feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed\\nbachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.”\\n\\n“I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,” answered the Linnet.  “The\\nfact is, that I told him a story with a moral.”\\n\\n“Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,” said the Duck.\\n\\nAnd I quite agree with her.\\n\\n     [Picture: Decorative graphic of windmill and overturned barrow]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Remarkable Rocket.\\n\\n\\n                     [Picture: The Remarkable Rocket]\\n\\nTHE King’s son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.\\nHe had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.\\nShe was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a\\nsledge drawn by six reindeer.  The sledge was shaped like a great golden\\nswan, and between the swan’s wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her\\nlong ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny\\ncap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she\\nhad always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets\\nall the people wondered.  “She is like a white rose!” they cried, and\\nthey threw down flowers on her from the balconies.\\n\\n  [Picture: Decorative graphic of young man kissing the princess’ hand]\\n\\nAt the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had\\ndreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he\\nsank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.\\n\\n“Your picture was beautiful,” he murmured, “but you are more beautiful\\nthan your picture”; and the little Princess blushed.\\n\\n“She was like a white rose before,” said a young Page to his neighbour,\\n“but she is like a red rose now”; and the whole Court was delighted.\\n\\nFor the next three days everybody went about saying, “White rose, Red\\nrose, Red rose, White rose”; and the King gave orders that the Page’s\\nsalary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not\\nof much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly\\npublished in the Court Gazette.\\n\\nWhen the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a\\nmagnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand\\nunder a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then\\nthere was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and\\nPrincess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear\\ncrystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips\\ntouched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.\\n\\n“It’s quite clear that they love each other,” said the little Page, “as\\nclear as crystal!” and the King doubled his salary a second time.  “What\\nan honour!” cried all the courtiers.\\n\\nAfter the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were\\nto dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the\\nflute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so,\\nbecause he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never\\nquite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for,\\nwhatever he did, everybody cried out, “Charming! charming!”\\n\\nThe last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be\\nlet off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a\\nfirework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal\\nPyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.\\n\\n“What are fireworks like?” she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she\\nwas walking on the terrace.\\n\\n“They are like the Aurora Borealis,” said the King, who always answered\\nquestions that were addressed to other people, “only much more natural.\\nI prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to\\nappear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must\\ncertainly see them.”\\n\\nSo at the end of the King’s garden a great stand had been set up, and as\\nsoon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place,\\nthe fireworks began to talk to each other.\\n\\n“The world is certainly very beautiful,” cried a little Squib.  “Just\\nlook at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could\\nnot be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the\\nmind wonderfully, and does away with all one’s prejudices.”\\n\\n“The King’s garden is not the world, you foolish squib,” said a big Roman\\nCandle; “the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days\\nto see it thoroughly.”\\n\\n“Any place you love is the world to you,” exclaimed a pensive Catherine\\nWheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided\\nherself on her broken heart; “but love is not fashionable any more, the\\npoets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed\\nthem, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I\\nremember myself once—But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the\\npast.”\\n\\n“Nonsense!” said the Roman Candle, “Romance never dies.  It is like the\\nmoon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love\\neach other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a\\nbrown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as\\nmyself, and knew the latest Court news.”\\n\\nBut the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  “Romance is dead, Romance is\\ndead, Romance is dead,” she murmured.  She was one of those people who\\nthink that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times,\\nit becomes true in the end.\\n\\nSuddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.\\n\\nIt came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end\\nof a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as\\nto attract attention.\\n\\n“Ahem! ahem!” he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine\\nWheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, “Romance is dead.”\\n\\n“Order! order!” cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician,\\nand had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew\\nthe proper Parliamentary expressions to use.\\n\\n“Quite dead,” whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.\\n\\nAs soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and\\nbegan.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating\\nhis memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he\\nwas talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.\\n\\n“How fortunate it is for the King’s son,” he remarked, “that he is to be\\nmarried on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had\\nbeen arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him;\\nbut, Princes are always lucky.”\\n\\n“Dear me!” said the little Squib, “I thought it was quite the other way,\\nand that we were to be let off in the Prince’s honour.”\\n\\n“It may be so with you,” he answered; “indeed, I have no doubt that it\\nis, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come\\nof remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel\\nof her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her\\ngreat public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went\\nout, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink\\nstars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very\\nbest gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French\\nextraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would\\nnever come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly\\ndisposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden\\nrain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering\\nterms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic\\nart.”\\n\\n“Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,” said a Bengal Light; “I know it is\\nPyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.”\\n\\n“Well, I said Pylotechnic,” answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of\\nvoice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to\\nbully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of\\nsome importance.\\n\\n“I was saying,” continued the Rocket, “I was saying—What was I saying?”\\n\\n“You were talking about yourself,” replied the Roman Candle.\\n\\n“Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was\\nso rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind,\\nfor I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive\\nas I am, I am quite sure of that.”\\n\\n“What is a sensitive person?” said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.\\n\\n“A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other\\npeople’s toes,” answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the\\nCracker nearly exploded with laughter.\\n\\n“Pray, what are you laughing at?” inquired the Rocket; “I am not\\nlaughing.”\\n\\n“I am laughing because I am happy,” replied the Cracker.\\n\\n“That is a very selfish reason,” said the Rocket angrily.  “What right\\nhave you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you\\nshould be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I\\nexpect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy.\\nIt is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose,\\nfor instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that\\nwould be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy\\nagain, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I\\nknow he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the\\nimportance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.”\\n\\n“If you want to give pleasure to others,” cried the Roman Candle, “you\\nhad better keep yourself dry.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits;\\n“that is only common sense.”\\n\\n“Common sense, indeed!” said the Rocket indignantly; “you forget that I\\nam very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common\\nsense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination,\\nfor I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as\\nbeing quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no\\none here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for\\nmyself, I don’t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is\\nthe consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this\\nis a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any\\nhearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and\\nPrincess had not just been married.”\\n\\n“Well, really,” exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, “why not?  It is a most\\njoyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the\\nstars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about\\nthe pretty bride.”\\n\\n“Ah! what a trivial view of life!” said the Rocket; “but it is only what\\nI expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why,\\nperhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there\\nis a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little\\nfair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps\\nsome day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may\\ngo to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall\\ninto the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor\\npeople, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall\\nnever get over it.”\\n\\n“But they have not lost their only son,” said the Roman Candle; “no\\nmisfortune has happened to them at all.”\\n\\n“I never said that they had,” replied the Rocket; “I said that they\\nmight.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying\\nanything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk.\\nBut when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very\\nmuch affected.”\\n\\n“You certainly are!” cried the Bengal Light.  “In fact, you are the most\\naffected person I ever met.”\\n\\n“You are the rudest person I ever met,” said the Rocket, “and you cannot\\nunderstand my friendship for the Prince.”\\n\\n“Why, you don’t even know him,” growled the Roman Candle.\\n\\n“I never said I knew him,” answered the Rocket.  “I dare say that if I\\nknew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing\\nto know one’s friends.”\\n\\n“You had really better keep yourself dry,” said the Fire-balloon.  “That\\nis the important thing.”\\n\\n“Very important for you, I have no doubt,” answered the Rocket, “but I\\nshall weep if I choose”; and he actually burst into real tears, which\\nflowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little\\nbeetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were\\nlooking for a nice dry spot to live in.\\n\\n“He must have a truly romantic nature,” said the Catherine Wheel, “for he\\nweeps when there is nothing at all to weep about”; and she heaved a deep\\nsigh, and thought about the deal box.\\n\\nBut the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept\\nsaying, “Humbug! humbug!” at the top of their voices.  They were\\nextremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called\\nit humbug.\\n\\nThen the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to\\nshine, and a sound of music came from the palace.\\n\\nThe Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so\\nbeautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and\\nwatched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.\\n\\nThen ten o’clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the\\nlast stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King\\nsent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.\\n\\n“Let the fireworks begin,” said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made\\na low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six\\nattendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a\\nlong pole.\\n\\nIt was certainly a magnificent display.\\n\\nWhizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.\\nBoom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the\\nplace, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  “Good-bye,”\\ncried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.\\nBang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves\\nimmensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.\\nHe was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best\\nthing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it\\nwas of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,\\nexcept with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers\\nwith blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little\\nPrincess laughed with pleasure.\\n\\n“I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,” said the\\nRocket; “no doubt that is what it means,” and he looked more supercilious\\nthan ever.\\n\\nThe next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  “This is evidently\\na deputation,” said the Rocket; “I will receive them with becoming\\ndignity” so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if\\nhe were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no\\nnotice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them\\ncaught sight of him.  “Hallo!” he cried, “what a bad rocket!” and he\\nthrew him over the wall into the ditch.\\n\\n“BAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket?” he said, as he whirled through the air;\\n“impossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.  BAD and GRAND\\nsound very much the same, indeed they often are the same”; and he fell\\ninto the mud.\\n\\n“It is not comfortable here,” he remarked, “but no doubt it is some\\nfashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my\\nhealth.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require\\nrest.”\\n\\nThen a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,\\nswam up to him.\\n\\n“A new arrival, I see!” said the Frog.  “Well, after all there is nothing\\nlike mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do\\nyou think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky\\nis quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!”\\n\\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket, and he began to cough.\\n\\n“What a delightful voice you have!” cried the Frog.  “Really it is quite\\nlike a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the\\nworld.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck\\npond close by the farmer’s house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.\\nIt is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact,\\nit was only yesterday that I heard the farmer’s wife say to her mother\\nthat she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is\\nmost gratifying to find oneself so popular.”\\n\\n“Ahem! ahem!” said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he\\ncould not get a word in.\\n\\n“A delightful voice, certainly,” continued the Frog; “I hope you will\\ncome over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have\\nsix beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He\\nis a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off\\nthem.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I\\nassure you.”\\n\\n“Conversation, indeed!” said the Rocket.  “You have talked the whole time\\nyourself.  That is not conversation.”\\n\\n“Somebody must listen,” answered the Frog, “and I like to do all the\\ntalking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.”\\n\\n“But I like arguments,” said the Rocket.\\n\\n“I hope not,” said the Frog complacently.  “Arguments are extremely\\nvulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.\\nGood-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little\\nFrog swam away.\\n\\n“You are a very irritating person,” said the Rocket, “and very ill-bred.\\nI hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to\\ntalk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and\\nselfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my\\ntemperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you\\nshould take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.\\nNow that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I\\nam going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at\\nCourt; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my\\nhonour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a\\nprovincial.”\\n\\n“There is no good talking to him,” said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on\\nthe top of a large brown bulrush; “no good at all, for he has gone away.”\\n\\n“Well, that is his loss, not mine,” answered the Rocket.  “I am not going\\nto stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like\\nhearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have\\nlong conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I\\ndon’t understand a single word of what I am saying.”\\n\\n“Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,” said the Dragon-fly;\\nand he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.\\n\\n“How very silly of him not to stay here!” said the Rocket.  “I am sure\\nthat he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However,\\nI don’t care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some\\nday”; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.\\n\\nAfter some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs,\\nand webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her\\nwaddle.\\n\\n“Quack, quack, quack,” she said.  “What a curious shape you are!  May I\\nask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?”\\n\\n“It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,” answered\\nthe Rocket, “otherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your\\nignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable\\nas oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up\\ninto the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.”\\n\\n“I don’t think much of that,” said the Duck, “as I cannot see what use it\\nis to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw\\na cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that\\nwould be something.”\\n\\n“My good creature,” cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, “I\\nsee that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is\\nnever useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than\\nsufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least\\nof all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have\\nalways been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who\\nhave nothing whatever to do.”\\n\\n“Well, well,” said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and\\nnever quarrelled with any one, “everybody has different tastes.  I hope,\\nat any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.”\\n\\n“Oh! dear no,” cried the Rocket.  “I am merely a visitor, a distinguished\\nvisitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is\\nneither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban.\\nI shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make\\na sensation in the world.”\\n\\n“I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,” remarked the Duck;\\n“there are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair\\nat a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning\\neverything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much\\neffect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.”\\n\\n“I am made for public life,” said the Rocket, “and so are all my\\nrelations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great\\nattention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will\\nbe a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and\\ndistracts one’s mind from higher things.”\\n\\n“Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!” said the Duck; “and\\nthat reminds me how hungry I feel”: and she swam away down the stream,\\nsaying, “Quack, quack, quack.”\\n\\n“Come back! come back!” screamed the Rocket, “I have a great deal to say\\nto you”; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  “I am glad that she has\\ngone,” he said to himself, “she has a decidedly middle-class mind”; and\\nhe sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the\\nloneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came\\nrunning down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.\\n\\n“This must be the deputation,” said the Rocket, and he tried to look very\\ndignified.\\n\\n“Hallo!” cried one of the boys, “look at this old stick!  I wonder how it\\ncame here”; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.\\n\\n“OLD Stick!” said the Rocket, “impossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he\\nsaid.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one\\nof the Court dignitaries!”\\n\\n“Let us put it into the fire!” said the other boy, “it will help to boil\\nthe kettle.”\\n\\nSo they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit\\nthe fire.\\n\\n“This is magnificent,” cried the Rocket, “they are going to let me off in\\nbroad day-light, so that every one can see me.”\\n\\n“We will go to sleep now,” they said, “and when we wake up the kettle\\nwill be boiled”; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.\\n\\nThe Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last,\\nhowever, the fire caught him.\\n\\n“Now I am going off!” he cried, and he made himself very stiff and\\nstraight.  “I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher\\nthan the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high\\nthat—”\\n\\nFizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.\\n\\n“Delightful!” he cried, “I shall go on like this for ever.  What a\\nsuccess I am!”\\n\\nBut nobody saw him.\\n\\nThen he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.\\n\\n“Now I am going to explode,” he cried.  “I shall set the whole world on\\nfire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for\\na whole year.”  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the\\ngunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.\\n\\nBut nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound\\nasleep.\\n\\nThen all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the\\nback of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.\\n\\n“Good heavens!” cried the Goose.  “It is going to rain sticks”; and she\\nrushed into the water.\\n\\n“I knew I should create a great sensation,” gasped the Rocket, and he\\nwent out.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\n                   Printed by BALLANTYNE & CO.

Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"

I believe this is the first English country house you\\nhave stayed at, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?\\n\\nHESTER.  We have not many.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady\\nCaroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as\\nbig as France and England put together.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.\\n[_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of\\nmy always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more\\ncharming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively\\ndamp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a\\nlittle lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane\\nmixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high\\ndistinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of\\nParliament, Mr. Kettle—\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his\\nname before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a\\nman, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.\\n\\nHESTER.  I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like\\nyourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are\\ninvited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord\\nBrancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she\\nwas married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t\\nbelieve she ran away more than once.\\n\\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady\\nHunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to\\nhave taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is\\nright in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,\\none never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not\\nconsidered the thing.\\n\\nHESTER.  In America those are the people we respect most.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I have no doubt of it.\\n\\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so\\nsincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come\\nacross.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young\\nlady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.\\nEnglish women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They\\nshow them then.\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young\\nman and a young girl?\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a\\ncushion_.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying\\nwhat a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful\\npower of selection.  It is quite a gift.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit\\nin very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will\\ncarry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.  [_To\\nFootman_.]  The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland.\\nGet the Shetland.  [_Exit Footman for shawl_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord\\nIllingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.  It\\nmeans a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear mother will be\\ndelighted.  I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.\\nDo you think she would, Gerald?  I know how difficult it is to get her to\\ngo anywhere.\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord\\nIllingworth had made me such an offer.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman with shawl_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come\\nup and meet him.  [_To Footman_.]  Just wait, Francis.  [_Writes\\nletter_.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as\\nyou are, Mr. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show\\nmyself worthy of it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I trust so.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ HESTER.]  _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss\\nWorsley.\\n\\nHESTER.  Are you very pleased about it?\\n\\nGERALD.  Of course I am.  It means everything to me—things that were out\\nof the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.\\n\\nHESTER.  Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.  Life is a hope.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord\\nIllingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that\\nmay not be true.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I don’t think that England should be represented abroad\\nby an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you are too\\nnervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I was in hopes he\\nwould have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he said her family was too\\nlarge.  Or was it her feet?  I forget which.  I regret it very much.  She\\nwas made to be an ambassador’s wife.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering\\npeople’s names, and forgetting their faces.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?  [_To\\nFootman_.]  Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a line to\\nyour dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she\\nreally must come to dinner.\\n\\n[_Exit Footman_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.  [_To_ HESTER.]\\nWill you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  With pleasure.  [_Exit with_ GERALD.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s good\\nfortune.  He is quite a _protégé_ of mine.  And I am particularly pleased\\nthat Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord\\nwithout my suggesting anything.  Nobody likes to be asked favours.  I\\nremember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season,\\nbecause she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to me.\\nIt was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking to be in\\nany respectable household.  I don’t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to\\nget rid of her.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that explains it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, the grass is too damp for you.  You had better go\\nand put on your overshoes at once.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You must allow me to be the best judge of that, John.\\nPray do as I tell you.\\n\\n[SIR JOHN _gets up and goes off_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!\\n\\n[_Enter_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\n[_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  Well, dear, I hope you like the park.  It is said\\nto be well timbered.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Quite, quite wonderful.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country\\nfor six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take\\nthe slightest notice of me.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I assure you, dear, that the country has not that\\neffect at all.  Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from\\nhere, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.  I remember the\\noccurrence perfectly.  Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of\\njoy, or gout.  I forget which.  We had a large party staying here at the\\ntime, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I think to elope is cowardly.  It’s running away from\\ndanger.  And danger has become so rare in modern life.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can make out, the young women of the present\\nday seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing\\nwith fire.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is\\nthat one never gets even singed.  It is the people who don’t know how to\\nplay with it who get burned up.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t know how the world would get on with such a\\ntheory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Ah!  The world was made for men and not for women.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Stutfield.  We have a much better\\ntime than they have.  There are far more things forbidden to us than are\\nforbidden to them.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; that is quite, quite true.  I had not thought of\\nthat.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?\\n\\nKELVIL.  I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.  It has\\nbeen an arduous task.  The demands on the time of a public man are very\\nheavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.  And I don’t think they meet with\\nadequate recognition.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, have you got your overshoes on?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Yes, my love.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think you had better come over here, John.  It is more\\nsheltered.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  You had better sit beside me.  [SIR\\nJOHN _rises and goes across_.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been writing about this morning, Mr.\\nKelvil?\\n\\nKELVIL.  On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield.  On Purity.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That must be such a very, very interesting thing to\\nwrite about.\\n\\nKELVIL.  It is the one subject of really national importance, nowadays,\\nLady Stutfield.  I purpose addressing my constituents on the question\\nbefore Parliament meets.  I find that the poorer classes of this country\\ndisplay a marked desire for a higher ethical standard.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How quite, quite nice of them.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Are you in favour of women taking part in politics, Mr.\\nKettle?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in\\nour political life, Lady Caroline.  Women are always on the side of\\nmorality, public and private.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It is so very, very gratifying to hear you say that.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes!—the moral qualities in women—that is the\\nimportant thing.  I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord Illingworth\\ndoesn’t value the moral qualities in women as much as he should.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, very\\nwicked.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  But what world says that, Lady Stutfield?  It must be\\nthe next world.  This world and I are on excellent terms.  [_Sits down\\nbeside_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Every one _I_ know says you are very, very wicked.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about,\\nnowadays, saying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely\\nand entirely true.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless, Lady\\nStutfield.  I have given up trying to reform him.  It would take a Public\\nCompany with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that.  But\\nyou have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth, haven’t you?  Gerald\\nArbuthnot has told us of his good fortune; it is really most kind of you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Hunstanton.  Kind is a\\ndreadful word.  I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I met\\nhim, and he’ll be of considerable use to me in something I am foolish\\nenough to think of doing.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  He is an admirable young man.  And his mother is one of\\nmy dearest friends.  He has just gone for a walk with our pretty\\nAmerican.  She is very pretty, is she not?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Far too pretty.  These American girls carry off all the\\ngood matches.  Why can’t they stay in their own country?  They are always\\ntelling us it is the Paradise of women.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is, Lady Caroline.  That is why, like Eve, they are\\nso extremely anxious to get out of it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Who are Miss Worsley’s parents?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American women are wonderfully clever in concealing\\ntheir parents.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean?  Miss\\nWorsley, Caroline, is an orphan.  Her father was a very wealthy\\nmillionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained my son\\nquite hospitably, when he visited Boston.  I don’t know how he made his\\nmoney, originally.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I fancy in American dry goods.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are American dry goods?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American novels.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How very singular! . . . Well, from whatever source her\\nlarge fortune came, I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley.  She dresses\\nexceedingly well.  All Americans do dress well.  They get their clothes\\nin Paris.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans die\\nthey go to Paris.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Indeed?  And when bad Americans die, where do they go\\nto?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, they go to America.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am afraid you don’t appreciate America, Lord Illingworth.  It\\nis a very remarkable country, especially considering its youth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The youth of America is their oldest tradition.  It\\nhas been going on now for three hundred years.  To hear them talk one\\nwould imagine they were in their first childhood.  As far as civilisation\\ngoes they are in their second.\\n\\nKELVIL.  There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in American\\npolitics.  I suppose you allude to that?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I wonder.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.  They\\ncertainly are in England.  Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country.  I\\nwonder Mrs. Cardew allows him.  I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don’t\\nthink that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I think they are the only people who should.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Do you take no side then in modern politics, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil.\\nTaking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows\\nshortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore.  However, the\\nHouse of Commons really does very little harm.  You can’t make people\\ngood by Act of Parliament,—that is something.\\n\\nKELVIL.  You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown great\\nsympathy with the sufferings of the poor.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is its special vice.  That is the special vice of\\nthe age.  One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of\\nlife.  The less said about life’s sores the better, Mr. Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Still our East End is a very important problem.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  It is the problem of slavery.  And we are\\ntrying to solve it by amusing the slaves.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, a great deal may be done by means of cheap\\nentertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth.  Dear Dr. Daubeny, our\\nrector here, provides, with the assistance of his curates, really\\nadmirable recreations for the poor during the winter.  And much good may\\nbe done by means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some popular\\namusement of that kind.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not at all in favour of amusements for the poor,\\nJane.  Blankets and coals are sufficient.  There is too much love of\\npleasure amongst the upper classes as it is.  Health is what we want in\\nmodern life.  The tone is not healthy, not healthy at all.\\n\\nKELVIL.  You are quite right, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I believe I am usually right.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Horrid word ‘health.’\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Silliest word in our language, and one knows so well\\nthe popular idea of health.  The English country gentleman galloping\\nafter a fox—the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.\\n\\nKELVIL.  May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House of Lords as\\na better institution than the House of Commons?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A much better institution, of course.  We in the House\\nof Lords are never in touch with public opinion.  That makes us a\\ncivilised body.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Are you serious in putting forward such a view?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\nVulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after one has\\ngiven them an idea, whether one is serious or not.  Nothing is serious\\nexcept passion.  The intellect is not a serious thing, and never has\\nbeen.  It is an instrument on which one plays, that is all.  The only\\nserious form of intellect I know is the British intellect.  And on the\\nBritish intellect the illiterates play the drum.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are you saying, Lord Illingworth, about the drum?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about the leading\\narticles in the London newspapers.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you believe all that is written in the\\nnewspapers?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do.  Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs.\\n[_Rises with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Are you going, Mrs. Allonby?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Just as far as the conservatory.  Lord Illingworth told me\\nthis morning that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven\\ndeadly sins.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind.  I will\\ncertainly speak to the gardener.\\n\\n[_Exit_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She lets her clever tongue run away with her sometimes.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows to run\\naway with her?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope so, Caroline, I am sure.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nDear Lord Alfred, do join us.  [LORD ALFRED _sits down beside_ LADY\\nSTUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You believe good of every one, Jane.  It is a great\\nfault.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, that one\\nshould believe evil of every one?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think it is much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield.\\nUntil, of course, people are found out to be good.  But that requires a\\ngreat deal of investigation nowadays.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But there is so much unkind scandal in modern life.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner that\\nthe basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant man, but he\\nseems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and purity\\nof life which is so important in this century.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, quite, quite important, is it not?\\n\\nKELVIL.  He gives me the impression of a man who does not appreciate the\\nbeauty of our English home-life.  I would say that he was tainted with\\nforeign ideas on the subject.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of home-life,\\nis there?\\n\\nKELVIL.  It is the mainstay of our moral system in England, Lady\\nStutfield.  Without it we would become like our neighbours.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That would be so, so sad, would it not?\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards woman simply as\\na toy.  Now, I have never regarded woman as a toy.  Woman is the\\nintellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life.  Without her\\nwe should forget the true ideals.  [_Sits down beside_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I am so very, very glad to hear you say that.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You a married man, Mr. Kettle?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, dear, Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am married, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Family?\\n\\nKELVIL.  Yes.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  How many?\\n\\nKELVIL.  Eight.\\n\\n[LADY STUTFIELD _turns her attention to_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at the\\nseaside?  [SIR JOHN _shrugs his shoulders_.]\\n\\nKELVIL.  My wife is at the seaside with the children, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You will join them later on, no doubt?\\n\\nKELVIL.  If my public engagements permit me.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Your public life must be a great source of gratification\\nto Mrs. Kettle.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_To_ LORD ALFRED.]  How very, very charming those\\ngold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord Alfred.\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  They are awfully expensive.  I can only afford them when\\nI’m in debt.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be in debt.\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  One must have some occupation nowadays.  If I hadn’t my\\ndebts I shouldn’t have anything to think about.  All the chaps I know are\\nin debt.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But don’t the people to whom you owe the money give you\\na great, great deal of annoyance?\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  Oh, no, they write; I don’t.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very strange.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs.\\nArbuthnot.  She won’t dine.  I am so sorry.  But she will come in the\\nevening.  I am very pleased indeed.  She is one of the sweetest of women.\\nWrites a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm.  [_Hands letter to_ LADY\\nCAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Looking at it_.]  A little lacking in femininity, Jane.\\nFemininity is the quality I admire most in women.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Taking back letter and leaving it on table_.]  Oh!\\nshe is very feminine, Caroline, and so good too.  You should hear what\\nthe Archdeacon says of her.  He regards her as his right hand in the\\nparish.  [_Footman speaks to her_.]  In the Yellow Drawing-room.  Shall\\nwe all go in?  Lady Stutfield, shall we go in to tea?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton.  [_They rise and proceed\\nto go off_.  SIR JOHN offers to carry LADY STUTFIELD’S cloak.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!  If you would allow your nephew to look after Lady\\nStutfield’s cloak, you might help me with my workbasket.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Certainly, my love.  [_Exeunt_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Curious thing, plain women are always jealous of their\\nhusbands, beautiful women never are!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Beautiful women never have time.  They are always so\\noccupied in being jealous of other people’s husbands.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should have thought Lady Caroline would have grown tired\\nof conjugal anxiety by this time!  Sir John is her fourth!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So much marriage is certainly not becoming.  Twenty\\nyears of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of\\nmarriage make her something like a public building.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Twenty years of romance!  Is there such a thing?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Not in our day.  Women have become too brilliant.\\nNothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Or the want of it in the man.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are quite right.  In a Temple every one should be\\nserious, except the thing that is worshipped.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And that should be man?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Women kneel so gracefully; men don’t.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for\\nthe last quarter of an hour.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Is she such a mystery?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is more than a mystery—she is a mood.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Moods don’t last.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is their chief charm.\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me, Lady\\nHunstanton and Lady Caroline, and . . . every one.  I hope I shall make a\\ngood secretary.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald.  [_Talks to\\nhim_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You enjoy country life, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  Very much indeed.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Don’t find yourself longing for a London dinner-party?\\n\\nHESTER.  I dislike London dinner-parties.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I adore them.  The clever people never listen, and the\\nstupid people never talk.\\n\\nHESTER.  I think the stupid people talk a great deal.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, I never listen!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy, if I didn’t like you I wouldn’t have made\\nyou the offer.  It is because I like you so much that I want to have you\\nwith me.\\n\\n[_Exit_ HESTER _with_ GERALD.]\\n\\nCharming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He is very nice; very nice indeed.  But I can’t stand the\\nAmerican young lady.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud voice too, that\\nshe was only eighteen.  It was most annoying.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never trust a woman who tells one her real\\nage.  A woman who would tell one that, would tell one anything.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She is a Puritan besides—\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah, that is inexcusable.  I don’t mind plain women\\nbeing Puritans.  It is the only excuse they have for being plain.  But\\nshe is decidedly pretty.  I admire her immensely.  [_Looks steadfastly\\nat_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a thoroughly bad man you must be!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you call a bad man?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The sort of man who admires innocence.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And a bad woman?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are severe—on yourself.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Define us as a sex.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Sphinxes without secrets.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Does that include the Puritan women?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do you know, I don’t believe in the existence of\\nPuritan women?  I don’t think there is a woman in the world who would not\\nbe a little flattered if one made love to her.  It is that which makes\\nwomen so irresistibly adorable.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You think there is no woman in the world who would object\\nto being kissed?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Very few.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you sure?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Quite.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you think she’d do if I kissed her?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her\\nglove.  What would you do if she struck you across the face with her\\nglove?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Fall in love with her, probably.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Is that a challenge?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is an arrow shot into the air.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t you know that I always succeed in whatever I\\ntry?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I am sorry to hear it.  We women adore failures.  They\\nlean on us.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You worship successes.  You cling to them.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We are the laurels to hide their baldness.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And they need you always, except at the moment of\\ntriumph.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They are uninteresting then.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How tantalising you are!  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like\\nyou for.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only one thing?  And I have so many bad qualities.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, don’t be too conceited about them.  You may lose them\\nas you grow old.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I never intend to grow old.  The soul is born old but\\ngrows young.  That is the comedy of life.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And the body is born young and grows old.  That is life’s\\ntragedy.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Its comedy also, sometimes.  But what is the\\nmysterious reason why you will always like me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is that you have never made love to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have never done anything else.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Really?  I have not noticed it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How fortunate!  It might have been a tragedy for both\\nof us.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We should each have survived.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One can survive everything nowadays, except death, and\\nlive down anything except a good reputation.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Have you tried a good reputation?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of the many annoyances to which I have never\\nbeen subjected.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It may come.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why do you threaten me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nFRANCIS.  Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Tell her ladyship we are coming in.\\n\\nFRANCIS.  Yes, my lord.\\n\\n[_Exit_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Shall we go in to tea?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you like such simple pleasures?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I adore simple pleasures.  They are the last refuge of\\nthe complex.  But, if you wish, let us stay here.  Yes, let us stay here.\\nThe Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It ends with Revelations.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You fence divinely.  But the button has come of your\\nfoil.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I have still the mask.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It makes your eyes lovelier.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Thank you.  Come.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT’S _letter on table_, _and takes\\nit up and looks at envelope_.]  What a curious handwriting!  It reminds\\nme of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Who?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! no one.  No one in particular.  A woman of no\\nimportance.  [_Throws letter down_, _and passes up the steps of the\\nterrace with_ MRS. ALLONBY.  _They smile at each other_.]\\n\\n                                ACT DROP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSECOND ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.\\n                               _Door_ R.C.\\n\\n[_Ladies seated on sofas_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a\\nlittle!\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly\\nhappy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to\\nleave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing\\nspace after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be\\nabsolutely worn to shadows.\\n\\n[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up\\nto the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to\\nescape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their\\npower and use it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense\\nall this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper\\nplace.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re\\nnot married?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a\\nwife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going\\nabout society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry\\nwithin twelve months.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they’re in love with some\\none who, perhaps, is tied to another?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off\\nin a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to\\nmeddle with other people’s property.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other\\npeople’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the\\nonly true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we\\ndon’t belong to any one.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you really think, dear Caroline, that\\nlegislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,\\nall the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like\\nmarried men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I certainly never know one from the other.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man\\nhas home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad\\nexpression in the eyes of so many married men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly\\ntedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they\\nare not.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely\\nchanged since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor dear\\nHunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I’m tired of\\nmeeting him.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you renew him from time to time, don’t you?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh no, Lady Caroline.  I have only had one husband as yet.\\nI suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  With your views on life I wonder you married at all.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  So do I.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, I believe you are really very happy in\\nyour married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from others.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, I hope not, dear.  I knew his mother quite well.\\nShe was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland’s daughters.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Victoria Stratton?  I remember her perfectly.  A silly\\nfair-haired woman with no chin.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, Ernest has a chin.  He has a very strong chin, a\\nsquare chin.  Ernest’s chin is far too square.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But do you really think a man’s chin can be too square?\\nI think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be\\nquite, quite square.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield.  It\\nis only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I adore silent men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Ernest isn’t silent.  He talks the whole time.  But he\\nhas got no conversation.  What he talks about I don’t know.  I haven’t\\nlistened to him for years.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Have you never forgiven him then?  How sad that seems!\\nBut all life is very, very sad, is it not?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a _mauvais quart d’heure_\\nmade up of exquisite moments.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, there are moments, certainly.  But was it something\\nvery, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did?  Did he become angry with you, and\\nsay anything that was unkind or true?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh dear, no.  Ernest is invariably calm.  That is one of\\nthe reasons he always gets on my nerves.  Nothing is so aggravating as\\ncalmness.  There is something positively brutal about the good temper of\\nmost modern men.  I wonder we women stand it as well as we do.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men’s good temper shows they are not so sensitive\\nas we are, not so finely strung.  It makes a great barrier often between\\nhusband and wife, does it not?  But I would so much like to know what was\\nthe wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell\\neverybody else.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  I will make a point of repeating\\nit.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively\\non his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course\\nof his life.  I was very young at the time, so I didn’t believe him, I\\nneedn’t tell you.  Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any\\nkind till after I had been actually married four or five months.  I found\\nout then that what he had told me was perfectly true.  And that sort of\\nthing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Men always want to be a woman’s first love.  That is their\\nclumsy vanity.  We women have a more subtle instinct about things.  What\\nwe like is to be a man’s last romance.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I see what you mean.  It’s very, very beautiful.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, you don’t mean to tell me that you won’t\\nforgive your husband because he never loved any one else?  Did you ever\\nhear such a thing, Caroline?  I am quite surprised.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that\\nnothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages.  They\\napparently are getting remarkably rare.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, they’re quite out of date.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  How like the middle classes!\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes—is it not?—very, very like them.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  If what you tell us about the middle classes is true,\\nLady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit.  It is much to be\\nregretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently\\nfrivolous, under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to\\nbe.  It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we\\nall know of in society.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don’t think the frivolity of\\nthe wife has ever anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined\\nnowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else.  How\\ncan a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating\\nher as if she were a perfectly rational being?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a\\nsex that has been rational for millions and millions of years.  He can’t\\nhelp himself.  It is in his race.  The History of Woman is very\\ndifferent.  We have always been picturesque protests against the mere\\nexistence of common sense.  We saw its dangers from the first.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly most,\\nmost trying.  Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband.  I think\\nit would be so very, very helpful.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Husband?  There couldn’t be such a thing.  The\\ninstitution is wrong.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to _us_.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  He would probably be extremely realistic.\\n\\nMRS. CAROLINE.  The Ideal Man!  Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if\\nwe were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.  He should refuse\\nall our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims.  He should\\nencourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions.  He should\\nalways say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he\\nsays.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But how could he do both, dear?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should never run down other pretty women.  That would\\nshow he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much.  No; he\\nshould be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don’t attract\\nhim.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about\\nother women.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us\\nan answer all about ourselves.  He should invariably praise us for\\nwhatever qualities he knows we haven’t got.  But he should be pitiless,\\nquite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never\\ndreamed of possessing.  He should never believe that we know the use of\\nuseful things.  That would be unforgiveable.  But he should shower on us\\neverything we don’t want.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills\\nand compliments.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat\\nus with absolute respect when we are alone.  And yet he should be always\\nready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to\\nbecome miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment’s notice, and to\\noverwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be\\npositively violent at the end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever\\nat a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner.  And\\nwhen, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has\\nrefused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised\\nnever to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters,\\nhe should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long,\\nand send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine\\nquite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he\\nwas.  And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about\\neverywhere with one’s husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one\\nwas, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if\\nhis conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really\\nbadly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in\\nthe wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman’s duty to\\nforgive, and one can do it all over again from the beginning, with\\nvariations.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How clever you are, my dear!  You never mean a single\\nword you say.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  It has been quite, quite\\nentrancing.  I must try and remember it all.  There are such a number of\\ndetails that are so very, very important.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you have not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal\\nMan is to be.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  His reward?  Oh, infinite expectation.  That is quite\\nenough for him.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But men are so terribly, terribly exacting, are they\\nnot?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  That makes no matter.  One should never surrender.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Not even to the Ideal Man?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Certainly not to him.  Unless, of course, one wants to\\ngrow tired of him.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh! . . . yes.  I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\\nDo you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?  Or are\\nthere more than one?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, my dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Going over to her_.]  What has happened?  Do tell me.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_in a low voice_]  I had completely forgotten that the\\nAmerican young lady has been in the room all the time.  I am afraid some\\nof this clever talk may have shocked her a little.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that will do her so much good!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Let us hope she didn’t understand much.  I think I had\\nbetter go over and talk to her.  [_Rises and goes across to_ HESTER\\nWORSLEY.]  Well, dear Miss Worsley. [_Sitting down beside her_.]  How\\nquiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time!  I suppose\\nyou have been reading a book?  There are so many books here in the\\nlibrary.\\n\\nHESTER.  No, I have been listening to the conversation.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You mustn’t believe everything that was said, you know,\\ndear.\\n\\nHESTER.  I didn’t believe any of it\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That is quite right, dear.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Continuing_.]  I couldn’t believe that any women could really\\nhold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your\\nguests.  [_An awkward pause_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hear you have such pleasant society in America.\\nQuite like our own in places, my son wrote to me.\\n\\nHESTER.  There are cliques in America as elsewhere, Lady Hunstanton.  But\\ntrue American society consists simply of all the good women and good men\\nwe have in our country.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What a sensible system, and I dare say quite pleasant\\ntoo.  I am afraid in England we have too many artificial social barriers.\\nWe don’t see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes.\\n\\nHESTER.  In America we have no lower classes.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a very strange arrangement!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What is that dreadful girl talking about?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  She is painfully natural, is she not?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  There are a great many things you haven’t got in America,\\nI am told, Miss Worsley.  They say you have no ruins, and no curiosities.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_To_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  What nonsense!  They have their\\nmothers and their manners.\\n\\nHESTER.  The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities, Lady\\nCaroline.  They are sent over to us every summer, regularly, in the\\nsteamers, and propose to us the day after they land.  As for ruins, we\\nare trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or\\nstone.  [_Gets up to take her fan from table_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What is that, dear?  Ah, yes, an iron Exhibition, is it\\nnot, at that place that has the curious name?\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Standing by table_.]  We are trying to build up life, Lady\\nHunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests on here.\\nThis sounds strange to you all, no doubt.  How could it sound other than\\nstrange?  You rich people in England, you don’t know how you are living.\\nHow could you know?  You shut out from your society the gentle and the\\ngood.  You laugh at the simple and the pure.  Living, as you all do, on\\nothers and by them, you sneer at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread\\nto the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season.  With all your\\npomp and wealth and art you don’t know how to live—you don’t even know\\nthat.  You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the\\nbeauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of\\nlife, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing.  You have\\nlost life’s secret.  Oh, your English society seems to me shallow,\\nselfish, foolish.  It has blinded its eyes, and stopped its ears.  It\\nlies like a leper in purple.  It sits like a dead thing smeared with\\ngold.  It is all wrong, all wrong.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I don’t think one should know of these things.  It is\\nnot very, very nice, is it?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English\\nsociety so much.  You were such a success in it.  And you were so much\\nadmired by the best people.  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said\\nof you—but it was most complimentary, and you know what an authority he\\nis on beauty.\\n\\nHESTER.  Lord Henry Weston!  I remember him, Lady Hunstanton.  A man with\\na hideous smile and a hideous past.  He is asked everywhere.  No\\ndinner-party is complete without him.  What of those whose ruin is due to\\nhim?  They are outcasts.  They are nameless.  If you met them in the\\nstreet you would turn your head away.  I don’t complain of their\\npunishment.  Let all women who have sinned be punished.\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters from terrace behind in a cloak with a lace veil\\nover her head_.  _She hears the last words and starts_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady!\\n\\nHESTER.  It is right that they should be punished, but don’t let them be\\nthe only ones to suffer.  If a man and woman have sinned, let them both\\ngo forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there.  Let them\\nboth be branded.  Set a mark, if you wish, on each, but don’t punish the\\none and let the other go free.  Don’t have one law for men and another\\nfor women.  You are unjust to women in England.  And till you count what\\nis a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man, you will always be\\nunjust, and Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of cloud,\\nwill be made dim to your eyes, or be not seen at all, or if seen, not\\nregarded.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Might I, dear Miss Worsley, as you are standing up, ask\\nyou for my cotton that is just behind you?  Thank you.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Mrs. Arbuthnot!  I am so pleased you have come\\nup.  But I didn’t hear you announced.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, I came straight in from the terrace, Lady Hunstanton,\\njust as I was.  You didn’t tell me you had a party.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Not a party.  Only a few guests who are staying in the\\nhouse, and whom you must know.  Allow me.  [_Tries to help her_.  _Rings\\nbell_.]  Caroline, this is Mrs. Arbuthnot, one of my sweetest friends.\\nLady Caroline Pontefract, Lady Stutfield, Mrs. Allonby, and my young\\nAmerican friend, Miss Worsley, who has just been telling us all how\\nwicked we are.\\n\\nHESTER.  I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly, Lady Hunstanton.\\nBut there are some things in England—\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth, I\\ndare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it,\\nwhich is much more important, Lord Illingworth would tell us.  The only\\npoint where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady Caroline’s\\nbrother, about poor Lord Henry.  He is really such good company.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nTake Mrs. Arbuthnot’s things.\\n\\n[_Exit Footman with wraps_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  Lady Caroline, I had no idea it was your brother.  I am sorry\\nfor the pain I must have caused you—I—\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  My dear Miss Worsley, the only part of your little\\nspeech, if I may so term it, with which I thoroughly agreed, was the part\\nabout my brother.  Nothing that you could possibly say could be too bad\\nfor him.  I regard Henry as infamous, absolutely infamous.  But I am\\nbound to state, as you were remarking, Jane, that he is excellent\\ncompany, and he has one of the best cooks in London, and after a good\\ndinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relations.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_to_ MISS WORSLEY]  Now, do come, dear, and make friends\\nwith Mrs. Arbuthnot.  She is one of the good, sweet, simple people you\\ntold us we never admitted into society.  I am sorry to say Mrs. Arbuthnot\\ncomes very rarely to me.  But that is not my fault.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a bore it is the men staying so long after dinner!  I\\nexpect they are saying the most dreadful things about us.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really think so?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I was sure of it.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very horrid of them!  Shall we go onto the\\nterrace?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, anything to get away from the dowagers and the\\ndowdies.  [_Rises and goes with_ LADY STUTFIELD _to door_ L.C.]  We are\\nonly going to look at the stars, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You will find a great many, dear, a great many.  But\\ndon’t catch cold.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  We shall all miss Gerald so\\nmuch, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But has Lord Illingworth really offered to make Gerald\\nhis secretary?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, yes!  He has been most charming about it.  He has\\nthe highest possible opinion of your boy.  You don’t know Lord\\nIllingworth, I believe, dear.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have never met him.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You know him by name, no doubt?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am afraid I don’t.  I live so much out of the world,\\nand see so few people.  I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord\\nIllingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes.  That would be the last Earl but one.  He was\\na very curious man.  He wanted to marry beneath him.  Or wouldn’t, I\\nbelieve.  There was some scandal about it.  The present Lord Illingworth\\nis quite different.  He is very distinguished.  He does—well, he does\\nnothing, which I am afraid our pretty American visitor here thinks very\\nwrong of anybody, and I don’t know that he cares much for the subjects in\\nwhich you are so interested, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Do you think,\\nCaroline, that Lord Illingworth is interested in the Housing of the Poor?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I should fancy not at all, Jane.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  We all have our different tastes, have we not?  But\\nLord Illingworth has a very high position, and there is nothing he\\ncouldn’t get if he chose to ask for it.  Of course, he is comparatively a\\nyoung man still, and he has only come to his title within—how long\\nexactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworth succeeded?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  About four years, I think, Jane.  I know it was the same\\nyear in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I remember.  That would be about four years ago.\\nOf course, there were a great many people between the present Lord\\nIllingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  There was—who was there,\\nCaroline?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  There was poor Margaret’s baby.  You remember how anxious\\nshe was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and her husband\\ndied shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of Lord\\nAscot’s sons, who, I am told, beats her.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the family.\\nAnd there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic,\\nor a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know the\\nCourt of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that he was quite\\nsane.  And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumstead’s with straws in\\nhis hair, or something very odd about him.  I can’t recall what.  I often\\nregret, Lady Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son\\nget the title.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Cecilia?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Lord Illingworth’s mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, was one\\nof the Duchess of Jerningham’s pretty daughters, and she married Sir\\nThomas Harford, who wasn’t considered a very good match for her at the\\ntime, though he was said to be the handsomest man in London.  I knew them\\nall quite intimately, and both the sons, Arthur and George.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course, Lady\\nHunstanton?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field.  Or was\\nit fishing, Caroline?  I forget.  But George came in for everything.  I\\nalways tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has\\nhad.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once.\\nMight I see him?  Can he be sent for?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, dear.  I will send one of the servants into\\nthe dining-room to fetch him.  I don’t know what keeps the gentlemen so\\nlong.  [_Rings bell_.]  When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain\\nGeorge Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young man about town, with\\nnot a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him.  She\\nwas quite devoted to him.  Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms\\nwith his father.  Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon.  [_To Servant_.]  It\\ndoesn’t matter.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ DOCTOR DAUBENY.  SIR JOHN _goes over to_ LADY\\nSTUTFIELD, DOCTOR DAUBENY _to_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining.  I have\\nnever enjoyed myself more.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_To_ DOCTOR BAUBENY.]  You see I have got Mrs.\\nArbuthnot to come to me at last.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton.  Mrs. Daubeny\\nwill be quite jealous of you.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come with you\\nto-night.  Headache as usual, I suppose.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.  But she is\\nhappiest alone.  She is happiest alone.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_To her husband_.]  John!  [SIR JOHN _goes over to his\\nwife_.  DOCTOR BAUBENY _talks to_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT watches LORD ILLINGWORTH the whole time.  He has passed\\nacross the room without noticing her, and approaches MRS. ALLONBY, who\\nwith LADY STUTFIELD is standing by the door looking on to the terrace.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How is the most charming woman in the world?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [Taking LADY STUTFIELD by the hand.]  We are both quite\\nwell, thank you, Lord Illingworth.  But what a short time you have been\\nin the dining-room!  It seems as if we had only just left.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was bored to death.  Never opened my lips the whole\\ntime.  Absolutely longing to come in to you.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You should have.  The American girl has been giving us a\\nlecture.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Really?  All Americans lecture, I believe.  I suppose\\nit is something in their climate.  What did she lecture about?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Puritanism, of course.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am going to convert her, am I not?  How long do you\\ngive me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  A week.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A week is more than enough.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Going to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Dear mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, I don’t feel at all well.  See me home, Gerald.\\nI shouldn’t have come.\\n\\nGERALD.  I am so sorry, mother.  Certainly.  But you must know Lord\\nIllingworth first.  [_Goes across room_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Not to-night, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know my mother.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  With the greatest pleasure.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\nI’ll be back in a moment.  People’s mothers always bore me to death.  All\\nwomen become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  No man does.  That is his.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a delightful mood you are in to-night!  [_Turns\\nround and goes across with_ GERALD _to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  _When he sees\\nher_, _he starts back in wonder_.  _Then slowly his eyes turn towards_\\nGERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has offered to take me as\\nhis private secretary.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _bows coldly_.]  It is a\\nwonderful opening for me, isn’t it?  I hope he won’t be disappointed in\\nme, that is all.  You’ll thank Lord Illingworth, mother, won’t you?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth in very good, I am sure, to interest\\nhimself in you for the moment.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Putting his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  Oh,\\nGerald and I are great friends already, Mrs . . . Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There can be nothing in common between you and my son,\\nLord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, how can you say so?  Of course Lord Illingworth is\\nawfully clever and that sort of thing.  There is nothing Lord Illingworth\\ndoesn’t know.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy!\\n\\nGERALD.  He knows more about life than any one I have ever met.  I feel\\nan awful duffer when I am with you, Lord Illingworth.  Of course, I have\\nhad so few advantages.  I have not been to Eton or Oxford like other\\nchaps.  But Lord Illingworth doesn’t seem to mind that.  He has been\\nawfully good to me, mother.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth may change his mind.  He may not really\\nwant you as his secretary.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You must remember, as you said yourself, you have had so\\nfew advantages.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for a moment.  Do\\ncome over.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Will you excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot?  Now, don’t let\\nyour charming mother make any more difficulties, Gerald.  The thing is\\nquite settled, isn’t it?\\n\\nGERALD.  I hope so.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _goes across to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I thought you were never going to leave the lady in black\\nvelvet.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is excessively handsome.  [_Looks at_ MRS.\\nARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room?\\nMiss Worsley is going to play.  You’ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,\\nwon’t you?  You don’t know what a treat is in store for you.  [_To_\\nDOCTOR BAUBENY.]  I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to\\nthe rectory.  I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the\\nviolin.  Ah, I forgot.  Dear Mrs. Daubeny’s hearing is a little\\ndefective, is it not?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Her deafness is a great privation to her.  She can’t\\neven hear my sermons now.  She reads them at home.  But she has many\\nresources in herself, many resources.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She reads a good deal, I suppose?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Just the very largest print.  The eyesight is rapidly\\ngoing.  But she’s never morbid, never morbid.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  Do speak to my mother, Lord\\nIllingworth, before you go into the music-room.  She seems to think,\\nsomehow, you don’t mean what you said to me.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Aren’t you coming?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  In a few moments.  Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot\\nwould allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join\\nyou later on.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, of course.  You will have a great deal to say to\\nher, and she will have a great deal to thank you for.  It is not every\\nson who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  But I know you appreciate\\nthat, dear.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, don’t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord\\nIllingworth.  We can’t spare her.\\n\\n[_Exit following the other guests_.  _Sound of violin heard from\\nmusic-room_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So that is our son, Rachel!  Well, I am very proud of\\nhim.  He in a Harford, every inch of him.  By the way, why Arbuthnot,\\nRachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  One name is as good as another, when one has no right to\\nany name.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose so—but why Gerald?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  After a man whose heart I broke—after my father.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Well, Rachel, what in over is over.  All I have got to\\nsay now in that I am very, very much pleased with our boy.  The world\\nwill know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will be\\nsomething very near, and very dear.  It is a curious thing, Rachel; my\\nlife seemed to be quite complete.  It was not so.  It lacked something,\\nit lacked a son.  I have found my son now, I am glad I have found him.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You have no right to claim him, or the smallest part of\\nhim.  The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over\\ntwenty years.  Why not let me have him for a little now?  He is quite as\\nmuch mine as yours.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Are you talking of the child you abandoned?  Of the\\nchild who, as far as you are concerned, might have died of hunger and of\\nwant?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me.  It was\\nnot I who left you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I left you because you refused to give the child a name.\\nBefore my son was born, I implored you to marry me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I had no expectations then.  And besides, Rachel, I\\nwasn’t much older than you were.  I was only twenty-two.  I was\\ntwenty-one, I believe, when the whole thing began in your father’s\\ngarden.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old\\nenough to do right also.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities are always\\ninteresting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.  As for\\nsaying I left our child to starve, that, of course, is untrue and silly.\\nMy mother offered you six hundred a year.  But you wouldn’t take\\nanything.  You simply disappeared, and carried the child away with you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I wouldn’t have accepted a penny from her.  Your father\\nwas different.  He told you, in my presence, when we were in Paris, that\\nit was your duty to marry me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, duty is what one expects from others, it is not\\nwhat one does oneself.  Of course, I was influenced by my mother.  Every\\nman is when he is young.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am glad to hear you say so.  Gerald shall certainly\\nnot go away with you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What nonsense, Rachel!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Do you think I would allow my son—\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  _Our_ son.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son [LORD ILLINGWORTH _shrugs his shoulders_]—to go\\naway with the man who spoiled my youth, who ruined my life, who has\\ntainted every moment of my days?  You don’t realise what my past has been\\nin suffering and in shame.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, I must candidly say that I think\\nGerald’s future considerably more important than your past.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald cannot separate his future from my past.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is exactly what he should do.  That is exactly\\nwhat you should help him to do.  What a typical woman you are!  You talk\\nsentimentally, and you are thoroughly selfish the whole time.  But don’t\\nlet us have a scene.  Rachel, I want you to look at this matter from the\\ncommon-sense point of view, from the point of view of what is best for\\nour son, leaving you and me out of the question.  What is our son at\\npresent?  An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank in a third-rate\\nEnglish town.  If you imagine he is quite happy in such a position, you\\nare mistaken.  He is thoroughly discontented.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He was not discontented till he met you.  You have made\\nhim so.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Of course, I made him so.  Discontent is the first\\nstep in the progress of a man or a nation.  But I did not leave him with\\na mere longing for things he could not get.  No, I made him a charming\\noffer.  He jumped at it, I need hardly say.  Any young man would.  And\\nnow, simply because it turns out that I am the boy’s own father and he my\\nown son, you propose practically to ruin his career.  That is to say, if\\nI were a perfect stranger, you would allow Gerald to go away with me, but\\nas he is my own flesh and blood you won’t.  How utterly illogical you\\nare!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not allow him to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How can you prevent it?  What excuse can you give to\\nhim for making him decline such an offer as mine?  I won’t tell him in\\nwhat relations I stand to him, I need hardly say.  But you daren’t tell\\nhim.  You know that.  Look how you have brought him up.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have brought him up to be a good man.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  And what is the result?  You have educated\\nhim to be your judge if he ever finds you out.  And a bitter, an unjust\\njudge he will be to you.  Don’t be deceived, Rachel.  Children begin by\\nloving their parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely, if ever, do\\nthey forgive them.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  George, don’t take my son away from me.  I have had\\ntwenty years of sorrow, and I have only had one thing to love me, only\\none thing to love.  You have had a life of joy, and pleasure, and\\nsuccess.  You have been quite happy, you have never thought of us.  There\\nwas no reason, according to your views of life, why you should have\\nremembered us at all.  Your meeting us was a mere accident, a horrible\\naccident.  Forget it.  Don’t come now, and rob me of . . . of all I have\\nin the whole world.  You are so rich in other things.  Leave me the\\nlittle vineyard of my life; leave me the walled-in garden and the well of\\nwater; the ewe-lamb God sent me, in pity or in wrath, oh! leave me that.\\nGeorge, don’t take Gerald from me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, at the present moment you are not necessary to\\nGerald’s career; I am.  There is nothing more to be said on the subject.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not let him go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Here is Gerald.  He has a right to decide for himself.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother, I hope you have settled it all with Lord\\nIllingworth?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have not, Gerald.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother seems not to like your coming with me, for\\nsome reason.\\n\\nGERALD.  Why, mother?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I thought you were quite happy here with me, Gerald.  I\\ndidn’t know you were so anxious to leave me.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, how can you talk like that?  Of course I have been quite\\nhappy with you.  But a man can’t stay always with his mother.  No chap\\ndoes.  I want to make myself a position, to do something.  I thought you\\nwould have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth’s secretary.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not think you would be suitable as a private\\nsecretary to Lord Illingworth.  You have no qualifications.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs.\\nArbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I surely am\\nthe best judge.  And I can only tell you that your son has all the\\nqualifications I had hoped for.  He has more, in fact, than I had even\\nthought of.  Far more.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _remains silent_.]  Have you any\\nother reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don’t wish your son to accept this\\npost?\\n\\nGERALD.  Have you, mother?  Do answer.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.  We\\nare quite by ourselves here.  Whatever it is, I need not say I will not\\nrepeat it.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you would like to be alone with your son, I will\\nleave you.  You may have some other reason you don’t wish me to hear.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have no other reason.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing as\\nsettled.  Come, you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together.\\nAnd Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I think you have acted\\nvery, very wisely.\\n\\n[_Exit with_ GERALD.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is left alone_.  _She stands\\nimmobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face_.]\\n\\n                                 ACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHIRD ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n    _The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_.  _Door at back leading on to\\n                                terrace_.\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a\\nsofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I\\nknew she would come round in the end.\\n\\nGERALD.  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know\\nshe doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is\\nperfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I\\ncouldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value\\nwhatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is\\nnot a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.\\n\\nGERALD.  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on\\nyour side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing\\nlike youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in\\nlife’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom\\nwaiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,\\nlike most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I\\nwouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of\\nthe community.\\n\\nGERALD.  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.\\nI sometimes think she must have married beneath her.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts\\nhis hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father,\\nI suppose, Gerald?\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such\\na mother as I have had.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that\\nmost mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,\\nthat a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.\\nAfter all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such\\na hole as Wrockley, could you?\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is\\noften curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in\\nit.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Slowly_.]  I suppose there is.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good\\nwomen have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their\\ninterests are so petty, aren’t they?\\n\\nGERALD.  They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care\\nmuch about.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort\\nof thing.\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, yes, she’s always going to church.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only\\nthing worth being nowadays.  You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?\\nYou want to know life as it really is.  Not to be put of with any\\nold-fashioned theories about life.  Well, what you have to do at present\\nis simply to fit yourself for the best society.  A man who can dominate a\\nLondon dinner-table can dominate the world.  The future belongs to the\\ndandy.  It is the exquisites who are going to rule.\\n\\nGERALD.  I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always\\nbeen told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that\\nthey don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial.  By the way,\\nGerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.  Sentiment is all\\nvery well for the button-hole.  But the essential thing for a necktie is\\nstyle.  A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Laughing_.]  I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord\\nIllingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know\\nhow to talk.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to\\nevery man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you\\nwill have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.\\n\\nGERALD.  But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either\\nto feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!\\n\\nGERALD.  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of it\\nsimply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any real\\nsuccess in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule\\nsociety.  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.  You\\nmight just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at\\nonce.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You should never try to understand them.  Women are\\npictures.  Men are problems.  If you want to know what a woman really\\nmeans—which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do—look at her,\\ndon’t listen to her.\\n\\nGERALD.  But women are awfully clever, aren’t they?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always tell them so.  But, to the\\nphilosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over\\nmind—just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.\\n\\nGERALD.  How then can women have so much power as you say they have?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The history of women is the history of the worst form\\nof tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak over the\\nstrong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.\\n\\nGERALD.  But haven’t women got a refining influence?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Nothing refines but the intellect.\\n\\nGERALD.  Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren’t there?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.\\n\\nGERALD.  But there are good women in society, aren’t there?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Far too many.\\n\\nGERALD.  But do you think women shouldn’t be good?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never tell them so, they’d all become good\\nat once.  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.  Every woman is a rebel,\\nand usually in wild revolt against herself.\\n\\nGERALD.  You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Men marry because they are tired; women because they\\nare curious.  Both are disappointed.\\n\\nGERALD.  But don’t you think one can be happy when one is married?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Perfectly happy.  But the happiness of a married man,\\nmy dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.\\n\\nGERALD.  But if one is in love?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always be in love.  That is the reason one\\nshould never marry.\\n\\nGERALD.  Love is a very wonderful thing, isn’t it?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself.\\nAnd one ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a\\nromance.  But a really _grande passion_ is comparatively rare nowadays.\\nIt is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.  That is the one\\nuse of the idle classes in a country, and the only possible explanation\\nof us Harfords.\\n\\nGERALD.  Harfords, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is my family name.  You should study the Peerage,\\nGerald.  It is the one book a young man about town should know\\nthoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever\\ndone.  And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectly new life with me,\\nand I want you to know how to live.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _appears on terrace\\nbehind_.]  For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live\\nin it!\\n\\n[_Enter_ L.C. LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ DR. DAUBENY.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! here you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  Well, I\\nsuppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new\\nduties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good advice over a\\npleasant cigarette.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady\\nHunstanton, and the best of cigarettes.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I\\nsuppose I am too old now to learn.  Except from you, dear Archdeacon,\\nwhen you are in your nice pulpit.  But then I always know what you are\\ngoing to say, so I don’t feel alarmed.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah!\\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.  Come, dear.  [_Enter_ MRS.\\nARBUTHNOT.]  Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord\\nIllingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant\\nway in which everything has turned out for him.  Let us sit down.  [_They\\nsit down_.]  And how is your beautiful embroidery going on?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn’t she?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas.\\nBut the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal.  She has not touched\\nthe tambour frame for nine or ten years.  But she has many other\\namusements.  She is very much interested in her own health.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that is always a nice distraction, in it not?  Now,\\nwhat are you talking about, Lord Illingworth?  Do tell us.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the\\nworld has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in\\nwhich it has been able to bear them.  And that, consequently, whatever\\nthe world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now I am quite out of my depth.  I usually am when Lord\\nIllingworth says anything.  And the Humane Society is most careless.\\nThey never rescue me.  I am left to sink.  I have a dim idea, dear Lord\\nIllingworth, that you are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I\\nalways try to be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get.\\nAnd after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The only difference between the saint and the sinner\\nis that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that quite does for me.  I haven’t a word to say.\\nYou and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age.  We can’t follow Lord\\nIllingworth.  Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid.\\nTo have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays.  It shuts one\\nout from so much.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of\\nhis opinions.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are quite right, dear.\\n\\n[GERALD _shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother_.\\n_Enter_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Jane, have you seen John anywhere?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You needn’t be anxious about him, dear.  He is with\\nLady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room.\\nThey seem quite happy together.  You are not going, Caroline?  Pray sit\\ndown.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think I had better look after John.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It doesn’t do to pay men so much attention.  And\\nCaroline has really nothing to be anxious about.  Lady Stutfield is very\\nsympathetic.  She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about\\nanother.  A beautiful nature.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nAh! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs. Allonby too!  I suppose it was Mrs.\\nAllonby I saw him with.  Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere\\nfor you.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady\\nHunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! the Music-room, of course.  I thought it was the\\nYellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.  [_To the_\\nARCHDEACON.]  Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn’t she?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She used to be quite remarkable for her memory, but\\nsince her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early\\nchildhood.  But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great\\npleasure.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY STUTFIELD _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil been\\ntalking to you about?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Bimetallism!  Is that quite a nice subject?  However, I\\nknow people discuss everything very freely nowadays.  What did Sir John\\ntalk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  About Patagonia.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a remote topic!  But very improving, I\\nhave no doubt.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia.\\nSavages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost\\nall subjects.  They are excessively advanced.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What do they do?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Apparently everything.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it\\nnot, to find that Human Nature is permanently one.—On the whole, the\\nworld is the same world, is it not?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The world is simply divided into two classes—those who\\nbelieve the incredible, like the public—and those who do the improbable—\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Like yourself?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Yes; I am always astonishing myself.  It is the only\\nthing that makes life worth living.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful\\nqualities in my own nature.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah! don’t become quite perfect all at once.  Do it\\ngradually!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t intend to grow perfect at all.  At least, I\\nhope I shan’t.  It would be most inconvenient.  Women love us for our\\ndefects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything,\\neven our gigantic intellects.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis.  We forgive\\nadoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from us.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.  _He joins_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn’t we,\\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot?  I am sure you agree with me in that.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many\\nthings women should never forgive.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What sort of things?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The ruin of another woman’s life.\\n\\n[_Moves slowly away to back of stage_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe\\nthere are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and\\nreformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take\\nthings very, very easily.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is\\nunbecoming.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of\\nbeing terribly, terribly deceived.\\n\\nKELVIL.  The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  There is no secret of life.  Life’s aim, if it has\\none, is simply to be always looking for temptations.  There are not\\nnearly enough.  I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a\\nsingle one.  It is quite dreadful.  It makes one so nervous about the\\nfuture.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Shakes her fan at him_.]  I don’t know how it is,\\ndear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me\\nexcessively immoral.  It has been most interesting, listening to you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  All thought is immoral.  Its very essence is\\ndestruction.  If you think of anything, you kill it.  Nothing survives\\nbeing thought of.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t understand a word, Lord Illingworth.  But I\\nhave no doubt it is all quite true.  Personally, I have very little to\\nreproach myself with, on the score of thinking.  I don’t believe in women\\nthinking too much.  Women should think in moderation, as they should do\\nall things in moderation.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.  Nothing\\nsucceeds like excess.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope I shall remember that.  It sounds an admirable\\nmaxim.  But I’m beginning to forget everything.  It’s a great misfortune.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady\\nHunstanton.  No woman should have a memory.  Memory in a woman is the\\nbeginning of dowdiness.  One can always tell from a woman’s bonnet\\nwhether she has got a memory or not.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  You\\nalways find out that one’s most glaring fault is one’s most important\\nvirtue.  You have the most comforting views of life.\\n\\n[_Enter_ FARQUHAR.]\\n\\nFARQUHAR.  Doctor Daubeny’s carriage!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Archdeacon!  It is only half-past ten.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  [_Rising_.]  I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton.\\nTuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny’s bad nights.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  Well, I won’t keep you from her.  [_Goes\\nwith him towards door_.]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of\\npartridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never touches\\nsolids now.  Lives entirely on jellies.  But she is wonderfully cheerful,\\nwonderfully cheerful.  She has nothing to complain of.\\n\\n[_Exit with_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Goes over to_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  There is a beautiful\\nmoon to-night.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Let us go and look at it.  To look at anything that is\\ninconstant is charming nowadays.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You have your looking-glass.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is unkind.  It merely shows me my wrinkles.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Mine is better behaved.  It never tells me the truth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then it is in love with you.\\n\\n[_Exeunt_ SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH]  May I come too?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do, my dear boy.  [_Moves towards with_ MRS. ALLONBY\\n_and_ GERALD.]\\n\\n[LADY CAROLINE _enters_, _looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite\\ndirection to that taken by_ SIR JOHN _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  What, mother!\\n\\n[_Exit_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is getting late.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother.  Do let us wait a little longer.  Lord\\nIllingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a great\\nsurprise for you.  We are starting for India at the end of this month.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid\\ngood-bye to Lord Illingworth first.  I’ll be back in five minutes.\\n[_Exit_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him—not\\nwith him!  I couldn’t bear it.  [_Walks up and down_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER.]\\n\\nHESTER.  What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Is it?\\n\\nHESTER.  Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You are so\\ndifferent from the other women here.  When you came into the Drawing-room\\nthis evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and\\npure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are things that are right to\\nsay, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.\\n\\nHESTER.  I didn’t know you had heard it.  But I knew you would agree with\\nme.  A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn’t she?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  She shouldn’t be allowed to come into the society of good men\\nand women?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  She should not.\\n\\nHESTER.  And the man should be punished in the same way?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  In the same way.  And the children, if there are\\nchildren, in the same way also?\\n\\nHESTER.  Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited\\non the children.  It is a just law.  It is God’s law.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is one of God’s terrible laws.\\n\\n[_Moves away to fireplace_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth?  Of course\\nthere is position, no doubt, and money, but position and money are not\\neverything, are they?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  They are nothing; they bring misery.\\n\\nHESTER.  Then why do you let your son go with him?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He wishes it himself.\\n\\nHESTER.  But if you asked him he would stay, would he not?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He has set his heart on going.\\n\\nHESTER.  He couldn’t refuse you anything.  He loves you too much.  Ask\\nhim to stay.  Let me send him in to you.  He is on the terrace at this\\nmoment with Lord Illingworth.  I heard them laughing together as I passed\\nthrough the Music-room.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.  It is of no\\nconsequence.\\n\\nHESTER.  No, I’ll tell him you want him.  Do—do ask him to stay.  [_Exit_\\nHESTER.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He won’t come—I know he won’t come.\\n\\n[Enter LADY CAROLINE.  _She looks round anxiously_.  _Enter_ GERALD.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the\\nterrace?\\n\\nGERALD.  No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is very curious.  It is time for him to retire.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting.  I forgot all about\\nit.  I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so happy.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  At the prospect of going away?\\n\\nGERALD.  Don’t put it like that, mother.  Of course I am sorry to leave\\nyou.  Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.  But after all, as\\nLord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a place as\\nWrockley.  You don’t mind it.  But I’m ambitions; I want something more\\nthan that.  I want to have a career.  I want to do something that will\\nmake you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth is going to help me.  He is\\ngoing to do everything for me.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, don’t go away with Lord Illingworth.  I implore\\nyou not to.  Gerald, I beg you!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, how changeable you are!  You don’t seem to know your own\\nmind for a single moment.  An hour and a half ago in the Drawing-room you\\nagreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and make objections, and\\ntry to force me to give up my one chance in life.  Yes, my one chance.\\nYou don’t suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every\\nday, do you, mother?  It is very strange that when I have had such a\\nwonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties in my\\nway should be my own mother.  Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester\\nWorsley.  Who could help loving her?  I love her more than I have ever\\ntold you, far more.  And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I\\ncould—I could ask her to—Don’t you understand now, mother, what it means\\nto me to be Lord Illingworth’s secretary?  To start like that is to find\\na career ready for one—before one—waiting for one.  If I were Lord\\nIllingworth’s secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.  As a wretched\\nbank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.  I know\\nher views on life.  She has just told them to me.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Then I have my ambition left, at any rate.  That is something—I\\nam glad I have that!  You have always tried to crush my ambition,\\nmother—haven’t you?  You have told me that the world is a wicked place,\\nthat success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that\\nsort of thing—well, I don’t believe it, mother.  I think the world must\\nbe delightful.  I think society must be exquisite.  I think success is a\\nthing worth having.  You have been wrong in all that you taught me,\\nmother, quite wrong.  Lord Illingworth is a successful man.  He is a\\nfashionable man.  He is a man who lives in the world and for it.  Well, I\\nwould give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I would sooner see you dead.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth?  Tell\\nme—tell me right out.  What is it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is a bad man.\\n\\nGERALD.  In what way bad?  I don’t understand what you mean.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will tell you.\\n\\nGERALD.  I suppose you think him bad, because he doesn’t believe the same\\nthings as you do.  Well, men are different from women, mother.  It is\\nnatural that they should have different views.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is not what Lord Illingworth believes, or what he\\ndoes not believe, that makes him bad.  It is what he is.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, is it something you know of him?  Something you actually\\nknow?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is something I know.\\n\\nGERALD.  Something you are quite sure of?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Quite sure of.\\n\\nGERALD.  How long have you known it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For twenty years.\\n\\nGERALD.  Is it fair to go back twenty years in any man’s career?  And\\nwhat have you or I to do with Lord Illingworth’s early life?  What\\nbusiness is it of ours?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What this man has been, he is now, and will be always.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did?  If he did anything\\nshameful, I will not go away with him.  Surely you know me well enough\\nfor that?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, come near to me.  Quite close to me, as you used\\nto do when you were a little boy, when you were mother’s own boy.\\n[GERALD _sits down betide his mother_.  _She runs her fingers through his\\nhair_, _and strokes his hands_.]  Gerald, there was a girl once, she was\\nvery young, she was little over eighteen at the time.  George\\nHarford—that was Lord Illingworth’s name then—George Harford met her.\\nShe knew nothing about life.  He—knew everything.  He made this girl love\\nhim.  He made her love him so much that she left her father’s house with\\nhim one morning.  She loved him so much, and he had promised to marry\\nher!  He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him.\\nShe was very young, and—and ignorant of what life really is.  But he put\\nthe marriage off from week to week, and month to month.—She trusted in\\nhim all the while.  She loved him.—Before her child was born—for she had\\na child—she implored him for the child’s sake to marry her, that the\\nchild might have a name, that her sin might not be visited on the child,\\nwho was innocent.  He refused.  After the child was born she left him,\\ntaking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and\\nall that was sweet, and good, and pure in her ruined also.  She suffered\\nterribly—she suffers now.  She will always suffer.  For her there is no\\njoy, no peace, no atonement.  She is a woman who drags a chain like a\\nguilty thing.  She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing that is a\\nleper.  The fire cannot purify her.  The waters cannot quench her\\nanguish.  Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her sleep! no poppies\\nforgetfulness!  She is lost!  She is a lost soul!—That is why I call Lord\\nIllingworth a bad man.  That is why I don’t want my boy to be with him.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of course.  But I\\ndare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth\\nwas.—After all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice feelings\\nat all, go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married, and\\nlive with him as his wife?  No nice girl would.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_After a pause_.]  Gerald, I withdraw all my\\nobjections.  You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth, when\\nand where you choose.\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I knew you wouldn’t stand in my way.  You are the\\nbest woman God ever made.  And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don’t believe\\nhe is capable of anything infamous or base.  I can’t believe it of him—I\\ncan’t.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Outside_.]  Let me go!  Let me go!  [_Enter_ HESTER _in\\nterror_, _and rushes over to_ GERALD _and flings herself in his arms_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  Oh! save me—save me from him!\\n\\nGERALD.  From whom?\\n\\nHESTER.  He has insulted me!  Horribly insulted me!  Save me!\\n\\nGERALD.  Who?  Who has dared—?\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters at back of stage_.  HESTER _breaks from_\\nGERALD’S _arms and points to him_.]\\n\\nGERALD  [_He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation_.]  Lord\\nIllingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God’s earth, a thing\\nas pure as my own mother.  You have insulted the woman I love most in the\\nworld with my own mother.  As there is a God in Heaven, I will kill you!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rushing across and catching hold of him_]  No! no!\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Thrusting her back_.]  Don’t hold me, mother.  Don’t hold\\nme—I’ll kill him!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  Let me go, I say!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Stop, Gerald, stop!  He is your own father!\\n\\n[GERALD _clutches his mother’s hands and looks into her face_.  _She\\nsinks slowly on the ground in shame_.  HESTER _steals towards the door_.\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH _frowns and bites his lip_.  _After a time_ GERALD\\n_raises his mother up_, _puts his am round her_, _and leads her from the\\nroom_.]\\n\\n                                 ACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOURTH ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n_Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s_.  _Large open French window at back_,\\n_looking on to garden_.  _Doors_ R.C. _and_ L.C.\\n\\n[GERALD ARBUTHNOT _writing at table_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ ALICE R.C. _followed by_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nALICE.  Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\n[_Exit_ L.C.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Good morning, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Rising_.]  Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs.\\nAllonby.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  We came to inquire for your dear\\nmother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?\\n\\nGERALD.  My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last\\nnight.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it\\nwas the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets\\non one’s nerves.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It’s the same thing, nowadays.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am\\nafraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.\\nArbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]  It looks\\nquite the happy English home.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.\\nOne feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,\\nGerald.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that\\na good influence is the worst in the world.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he\\nwill change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English\\nhome.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women\\nin London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but\\norchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a\\nsweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures\\nthat one can look at without blushing.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But I like blushing.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,\\nif one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell\\nme I didn’t blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very\\nparticular.  He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those\\nwho were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,\\nwas brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the\\ndevotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?\\nBy-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more\\noften now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you?\\n\\nGERALD.  I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s\\nsecretary.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Surely not, Gerald!  It would be most unwise of you.\\nWhat reason can you have?\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t think I should be suitable for the post.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.\\nBut he says I am not serious enough.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, you really mustn’t talk like that in this\\nhouse.  Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn’t know anything about the wicked society in\\nwhich we all live.  She won’t go into it.  She is far too good.  I\\nconsider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.  It gave\\nquite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in\\nthe air.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, how can you say that?  There is no resemblance\\nbetween the two things at all.  But really, Gerald, what do you mean by\\nnot being suitable?\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth’s views of life and mine are too different.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn’t have any\\nviews of life.  They are quite out of place.  You must be guided by\\nothers in this matter.  Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering\\noffer, and travelling with him you would see the world—as much of it, at\\nleast, as one should look at—under the best auspices possible, and stay\\nwith all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in\\nyour career.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t want to see the world: I’ve seen enough of it.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I hope you don’t think you have exhausted life, Mr.\\nArbuthnot.  When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t wish to leave my mother.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part.  Not\\nleave your mother!  If I were your mother I would insist on your going.\\n\\n[_Enter_ ALICE L.C.]\\n\\nALICE.  Mrs. Arbuthnot’s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad\\nheadache, and cannot see any one this morning.  [_Exit_ R.C.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps\\nyou’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better,\\nGerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, to-morrow, then.  Ah, if you had a father,\\nGerald, he wouldn’t let you waste your life here.  He would send you off\\nwith Lord Illingworth at once.  But mothers are so weak.  They give up to\\ntheir sons in everything.  We are all heart, all heart.  Come, dear, I\\nmust call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid,\\nis far from well.  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite\\nwonderful.  He is the most sympathetic of husbands.  Quite a model.\\nGood-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nGERALD.  Good-bye.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.  GERALD _sits down and reads\\nover his letter_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  What name can I sign?  I, who have no right to any name.\\n[_Signs name_, _puts letter into envelope_, _addresses it_, _and is about\\nto seal it_, _when door_ L.C. _opens and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters_.\\nGERALD _lays down sealing-wax_.  _Mother and son look at each other_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Through French window at the back_.]  Good-bye again,\\nGerald.  We are taking the short cut across your pretty garden.  Now,\\nremember my advice to you—start at once with Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  _Au revoir_, Mr. Arbuthnot.  Mind you bring me back\\nsomething nice from your travels—not an Indian shawl—on no account an\\nIndian shawl.\\n\\n[_Exeunt_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I have just written to him.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  To whom?\\n\\nGERALD.  To my father.  I have written to tell him to come here at four\\no’clock this afternoon.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He shall not come here.  He shall not cross the\\nthreshold of my house.\\n\\nGERALD.  He must come.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, if you are going away with Lord Illingworth, go\\nat once.  Go before it kills me: but don’t ask me to meet him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you don’t understand.  Nothing in the world would induce\\nme to go away with Lord Illingworth, or to leave you.  Surely you know me\\nwell enough for that.  No: I have written to him to say—\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What can you have to say to him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Can’t you guess, mother, what I have written in this letter?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, surely you can.  Think, think what must be done, now, at\\nonce, within the next few days.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is nothing to be done.\\n\\nGERALD.  I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him that he must\\nmarry you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Marry me?\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I will force him to do it.  The wrong that has been done\\nyou must be repaired.  Atonement must be made.  Justice may be slow,\\nmother, but it comes in the end.  In a few days you shall be Lord\\nIllingworth’s lawful wife.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald—\\n\\nGERALD.  I will insist upon his doing it.  I will make him do it: he will\\nnot dare to refuse.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald, it is I who refuse.  I will not marry Lord\\nIllingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  Not marry him?  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  But you don’t understand: it is for your sake I am talking, not\\nfor mine.  This marriage, this necessary marriage, this marriage which\\nfor obvious reasons must inevitably take place, will not help me, will\\nnot give me a name that will be really, rightly mine to bear.  But surely\\nit will be something for you, that you, my mother, should, however late,\\nbecome the wife of the man who is my father.  Will not that be something?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you must.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not.  You talk of atonement for a wrong done.\\nWhat atonement can be made to me?  There is no atonement possible.  I am\\ndisgraced: he is not.  That is all.  It is the usual history of a man and\\na woman as it usually happens, as it always happens.  And the ending is\\nthe ordinary ending.  The woman suffers.  The man goes free.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t know if that is the ordinary ending, mother: I hope it\\nis not.  But your life, at any rate, shall not end like that.  The man\\nshall make whatever reparation is possible.  It is not enough.  It does\\nnot wipe out the past, I know that.  But at least it makes the future\\nbetter, better for you, mother.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would\\ngive him a different answer.  Remember, he is my father.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  If he came himself, which he will not do, my answer\\nwould be the same.  Remember I am your mother.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you make it terribly difficult for me by talking like\\nthat; and I can’t understand why you won’t look at this matter from the\\nright, from the only proper standpoint.  It is to take away the\\nbitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow that lies on your\\nname, that this marriage must take place.  There is no alternative: and\\nafter the marriage you and I can go away together.  But the marriage must\\ntake place first.  It is a duty that you owe, not merely to yourself, but\\nto all other women—yes: to all the other women in the world, lest he\\nbetray more.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I owe nothing to other women.  There is not one of them\\nto help me.  There is not one woman in the world to whom I could go for\\npity, if I would take it, or for sympathy, if I could win it.  Women are\\nhard on each other.  That girl, last night, good though she is, fled from\\nthe room as though I were a tainted thing.  She was right.  I am a\\ntainted thing.  But my wrongs are my own, and I will bear them alone.  I\\nmust bear them alone.  What have women who have not sinned to do with me,\\nor I with them?  We do not understand each other.\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER _behind_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  I implore you to do what I ask you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What son has ever asked of his mother to make so hideous\\na sacrifice?  None.\\n\\nGERALD.  What mother has ever refused to marry the father of her own\\nchild?  None.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let me be the first, then.  I will not do it.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you believe in religion, and you brought me up to\\nbelieve in it also.  Well, surely your religion, the religion that you\\ntaught me when I was a boy, mother, must tell you that I am right.  You\\nknow it, you feel it.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not know it.  I do not feel it, nor will I ever\\nstand before God’s altar and ask God’s blessing on so hideous a mockery\\nas a marriage between me and George Harford.  I will not say the words\\nthe Church bids us to say.  I will not say them.  I dare not.  How could\\nI swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you\\ndishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin?  No: marriage\\nis a sacrament for those who love each other.  It is not for such as him,\\nor such as me.  Gerald, to save you from the world’s sneers and taunts I\\nhave lied to the world.  For twenty years I have lied to the world.  I\\ncould not tell the world the truth.  Who can, ever?  But not for my own\\nsake will I lie to God, and in God’s presence.  No, Gerald, no ceremony,\\nChurch-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to George Harford.  It\\nmay be that I am too bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left me\\nricher, so that in the mire of my life I found the pearl of price, or\\nwhat I thought would be so.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t understand you now.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Men don’t understand what mothers are.  I am no\\ndifferent from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I\\ndid, and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace.  And yet, to bear\\nyou I had to look on death.  To nurture you I had to wrestle with it.\\nDeath fought with me for you.  All women have to fight with death to keep\\ntheir children.  Death, being childless, wants our children from us.\\nGerald, when you were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave\\nyou food.  Night and day all that long winter I tended you.  No office is\\ntoo mean, no care too lowly for the thing we women love—and oh! how _I_\\nloved _you_.  Not Hannah, Samuel more.  And you needed love, for you were\\nweakly, and only love could have kept you alive.  Only love can keep any\\none alive.  And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain,\\nand we always fancy that when they come to man’s estate and know us\\nbetter they will repay us.  But it is not so.  The world draws them from\\nour side, and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are\\nwith us, and have amusements from which we are barred, and interests that\\nare not ours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life\\nbitter they blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste\\nits sweetness with them . . . You made many friends and went into their\\nhouses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to\\nfollow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat\\nin darkness.  What should I have done in honest households?  My past was\\never with me. . . . And you thought I didn’t care for the pleasant things\\nof life.  I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them,\\nfeeling I had no right.  You thought I was happier working amongst the\\npoor.  That was my mission, you imagined.  It was not, but where else was\\nI to go?  The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is\\npure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the\\nkiss of sin.  It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the\\nlove you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . .\\nAnd you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in\\nChurch duties.  But where else could I turn?  God’s house is the only\\nhouse where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart,\\nGerald, too much in my heart.  For, though day after day, at morn or\\nevensong, I have knelt in God’s house, I have never repented of my sin.\\nHow could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit!  Even now\\nthat you are bitter to me I cannot repent.  I do not.  You are more to me\\nthan innocence.  I would rather be your mother—oh! much rather!—than have\\nbeen always pure . . . Oh, don’t you see? don’t you understand?  It is my\\ndishonour that has made you so dear to me.  It is my disgrace that has\\nbound you so closely to me.  It is the price I paid for you—the price of\\nsoul and body—that makes me love you as I do.  Oh, don’t ask me to do\\nthis horrible thing.  Child of my shame, be still the child of my shame!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I didn’t know you loved me so much as that.  And I will\\nbe a better son to you than I have been.  And you and I must never leave\\neach other . . . but, mother . . . I can’t help it . . . you must become\\nmy father’s wife.  You must marry him.  It is your duty.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Running forwards and embracing_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  No, no; you\\nshall not.  That would be real dishonour, the first you have ever known.\\nThat would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.  Leave him and come\\nwith me.  There are other countries than England . . . Oh! other\\ncountries over sea, better, wiser, and less unjust lands.  The world is\\nvery wide and very big.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No, not for me.  For me the world is shrivelled to a\\npalm’s breadth, and where I walk there are thorns.\\n\\nHESTER.  It shall not be so.  We shall somewhere find green valleys and\\nfresh waters, and if we weep, well, we shall weep together.  Have we not\\nboth loved him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester!\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Waving him back_.]  Don’t, don’t!  You cannot love me at all,\\nunless you love her also.  You cannot honour me, unless she’s holier to\\nyou.  In her all womanhood is martyred.  Not she alone, but all of us are\\nstricken in her house.\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester, Hester, what shall I do?\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you respect the man who is your father?\\n\\nGERALD.  Respect him?  I despise him!  He is infamous.\\n\\nHESTER.  I thank you for saving me from him last night.\\n\\nGERALD.  Ah, that is nothing.  I would die to save you.  But you don’t\\ntell me what to do now!\\n\\nHESTER.  Have I not thanked you for saving _me_?\\n\\nGERALD.  But what should I do?\\n\\nHESTER.  Ask your own heart, not mine.  I never had a mother to save, or\\nshame.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is hard—he is hard.  Let me go away.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Rushes over and kneels down bedside his mother_.]  Mother,\\nforgive me: I have been to blame.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t kiss my hands: they are cold.  My heart is cold:\\nsomething has broken it.\\n\\nHESTER.  Ah, don’t say that.  Hearts live by being wounded.  Pleasure may\\nturn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but sorrow—oh, sorrow\\ncannot break it.  Besides, what sorrows have you now?  Why, at this\\nmoment you are more dear to him than ever, _dear_ though you have _been_,\\nand oh! how dear you _have_ been always.  Ah! be kind to him.\\n\\nGERALD.  You are my mother and my father all in one.  I need no second\\nparent.  It was for you I spoke, for you alone.  Oh, say something,\\nmother.  Have I but found one love to lose another?  Don’t tell me that.\\nO mother, you are cruel.  [_Gets up and flings himself sobbing on a\\nsofa_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_To_ HESTER.]  But has he found indeed another love?\\n\\nHESTER.  You know I have loved him always.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are very poor.\\n\\nHESTER.  Who, being loved, is poor?  Oh, no one.  I hate my riches.  They\\nare a burden.  Let him share it with me.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are disgraced.  We rank among the outcasts Gerald\\nis nameless.  The sins of the parents should be visited on the children.\\nIt is God’s law.\\n\\nHESTER.  I was wrong.  God’s law is only Love.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rises_, _and taking_ HESTER _by the hand_, _goes\\nslowly over to where_ GERALD _is lying on the sofa with his head buried\\nin his hands_.  _She touches him and he looks up_.]  Gerald, I cannot\\ngive you a father, but I have brought you a wife.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  So she comes first, you are worthy.  And when you are\\naway, Gerald . . . with . . . her—oh, think of me sometimes.  Don’t\\nforget me.  And when you pray, pray for me.  We should pray when we are\\nhappiest, and you will be happy, Gerald.\\n\\nHESTER.  Oh, you don’t think of leaving us?\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you won’t leave us?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I might bring shame upon you!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For a little then: and if you let me, near you always.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Come out with us to the garden.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Later on, later on.  [_Exeunt_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT _goes towards door_ L.C.   _Stops at looking-glass over\\nmantelpiece and looks into it_.  _Enter_ ALICE R.C.]\\n\\nALICE.  A gentleman to see you, ma’am.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Say I am not at home.  Show me the card.  [_Takes card\\nfrom salver and looks at it_.]  Say I will not see him.\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _sees him in the glass and\\nstarts_, _but does not turn round_.  _Exit_ ALICE.]  What can you have to\\nsay to me to-day, George Harford?  You can have nothing to say to me.\\nYou must leave this house.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you and me now,\\nso some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three.  I\\nassure you, he will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son may come in at any moment.  I saved you last\\nnight.  I may not be able to save you again.  My son feels my dishonour\\nstrongly, terribly strongly.  I beg you to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sitting down_.]  Last night was excessively\\nunfortunate.  That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I\\nwanted to kiss her.  What harm is there in a kiss?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  A kiss may ruin a human life, George\\nHarford.  _I_ know that.  _I_ know that too well.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  We won’t discuss that at present.  What is of\\nimportance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son.  I am extremely fond\\nof him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired his\\nconduct last night immensely.  He took up the cudgels for that pretty\\nprude with wonderful promptitude.  He is just what I should have liked a\\nson of mine to be.  Except that no son of mine should ever take the side\\nof the Puritans: that is always an error.  Now, what I propose is this.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  According to our ridiculous English laws, I can’t\\nlegitimise Gerald.  But I can leave him my property.  Illingworth is\\nentailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a place.  He can have\\nAshby, which is much prettier, Harborough, which has the best shooting in\\nthe north of England, and the house in St. James Square.  What more can a\\ngentleman require in this world?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing more, I am quite sure.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in\\nthese democratic days.  As George Harford I had everything I wanted.  Now\\nI have merely everything that other people want, which isn’t nearly so\\npleasant.  Well, my proposal is this.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I told you I was not interested, and I beg you to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The boy is to be with you for six months in the year,\\nand with me for the other six.  That is perfectly fair, is it not?  You\\ncan have whatever allowance you like, and live where you choose.  As for\\nyour past, no one knows anything about it except myself and Gerald.\\nThere is the Puritan, of course, the Puritan in white muslin, but she\\ndoesn’t count.  She couldn’t tell the story without explaining that she\\nobjected to being kissed, could she?  And all the women would think her a\\nfool and the men think her a bore.  And you need not be afraid that\\nGerald won’t be my heir.  I needn’t tell you I have not the slightest\\nintention of marrying.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You come too late.  My son has no need of you.  You are\\nnot necessary.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you mean, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That you are not necessary to Gerald’s career.  He does\\nnot require you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do not understand you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Look into the garden.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _rises and goes\\ntowards window_.]  You had better not let them see you: you bring\\nunpleasant memories.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _looks out and starts_.]  She\\nloves him.  They love each other.  We are safe from you, and we are going\\naway.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Where?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  We will not tell you, and if you find us we will not\\nknow you.  You seem surprised.  What welcome would you get from the girl\\nwhose lips you tried to soil, from the boy whose life you have shamed,\\nfrom the mother whose dishonour comes from you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You have grown hard, Rachel.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I was too weak once.  It is well for me that I have\\nchanged.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was very young at the time.  We men know life too\\nearly.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  And we women know life too late.  That is the difference\\nbetween men and women.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, I want my son.  My money may be of no use to\\nhim now.  I may be of no use to him, but I want my son.  Bring us\\ntogether, Rachel.  You can do it if you choose.  [_Sees letter on\\ntable_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is no room in my boy’s life for you.  He is not\\ninterested in _you_.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then why does he write to me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What do you mean?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What letter is this?  [_Takes up letter_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That—is nothing.  Give it to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is addressed to _me_.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are not to open it.  I forbid you to open it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And in Gerald’s handwriting.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not to have been sent.  It is a letter he wrote\\nto you this morning, before he saw me.  But he is sorry now he wrote it,\\nvery sorry.  You are not to open it.  Give it to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It belongs to me.  [_Opens it_, _sits down and reads\\nit slowly_. MRS. ARBUTHNOT _watches him all the time_.]  You have read\\nthis letter, I suppose, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You know what is in it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t admit for a moment that the boy is right in\\nwhat he says.  I don’t admit that it is any duty of mine to marry you.  I\\ndeny it entirely.  But to get my son back I am ready—yes, I am ready to\\nmarry you, Rachel—and to treat you always with the deference and respect\\ndue to my wife.  I will marry you as soon as you choose.  I give you my\\nword of honour.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You made that promise to me once before and broke it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I will keep it now.  And that will show you that I\\nlove my son, at least as much as you love him.  For when I marry you,\\nRachel, there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender.  High\\nambitions, too, if any ambition is high.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I decline to marry you, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you serious?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do tell me your reasons.  They would interest me\\nenormously.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have already explained them to my son.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose they were intensely sentimental, weren’t\\nthey?  You women live by your emotions and for them.  You have no\\nphilosophy of life.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are right.  We women live by our emotions and for\\nthem.  By our passions, and for them, if you will.  I have two passions,\\nLord Illingworth: my love of him, my hate of you.  You cannot kill those.\\nThey feed each other.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What sort of love is that which needs to have hate as\\nits brother?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is the sort of love I have for Gerald.  Do you think\\nthat terrible?  Well it is terrible.  All love is terrible.  All love is\\na tragedy.  I loved you once, Lord Illingworth.  Oh, what a tragedy for a\\nwoman to have loved you!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So you really refuse to marry me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Because you hate me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And does my son hate me as you do?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am glad of that, Rachel.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He merely despises you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a pity!  What a pity for him, I mean.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t be deceived, George.  Children begin by loving\\ntheir parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely if ever do they\\nforgive them.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Reads letter over again_, _very slowly_.]  May I ask\\nby what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter, this beautiful,\\npassionate letter, believe that you should not marry his father, the\\nfather of your own child?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not I who made him see it.  It was another.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What _fin-de-siècle_ person?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The Puritan, Lord Illingworth.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces_, _then rises slowly and goes over to table\\nwhere his hat and gloves are_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is standing close to the\\ntable_.  _He picks up one of the gloves, and begins pulling it on_.]\\nThere is not much then for me to do here, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is good-bye, is it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For ever, I hope, this time, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How curious!  At this moment you look exactly as you\\nlooked the night you left me twenty years ago.  You have just the same\\nexpression in your mouth.  Upon my word, Rachel, no woman ever loved me\\nas you did.  Why, you gave yourself to me like a flower, to do anything I\\nliked with.  You were the prettiest of playthings, the most fascinating\\nof small romances . . . [_Pulls out watch_.]  Quarter to two!  Must be\\nstrolling back to Hunstanton.  Don’t suppose I shall see you there again.\\nI’m sorry, I am, really.  It’s been an amusing experience to have met\\namongst people of one’s own rank, and treated quite seriously too, one’s\\nmistress, and one’s—\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _snatches up glove and strikes_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _across\\nthe face with it_.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _starts_.  _He is dazed by the\\ninsult of his punishment_.  _Then he controls himself_, _and goes to\\nwindow and looks out at his son_.  _Sighs and leaves the room_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Falls sobbing on the sofa_.]  He would have said it.\\nHe would have said it.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ HESTER _from the garden_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother.  You never came out after all.  So we have\\ncome in to fetch you.  Mother, you have not been crying?  [_Kneels down\\nbeside her_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My boy!  My boy!  My boy!  [_Running her fingers through\\nhis hair_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Coming over_.]  But you have two children now.  You’ll let me\\nbe your daughter?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Looking up_.]  Would you choose me for a mother?\\n\\nHESTER.  You of all women I have ever known.\\n\\n[_They move towards the door leading into garden with their arms round\\neach other’s waists_.  GERALD _goes to table_ L.C. _for his hat_.  _On\\nturning round he sees_ LORD ILLINGWORTH’S _glove lying on the floor_,\\n_and picks it up_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Hallo, mother, whose glove is this?  You have had a visitor.\\nWho was it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  Oh! no one.

In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3.

Newby\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"

I believe this is the first English country house you\\nhave stayed at, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?\\n\\nHESTER.  We have not many.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady\\nCaroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as\\nbig as France and England put together.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.\\n[_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of\\nmy always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more\\ncharming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively\\ndamp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a\\nlittle lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane\\nmixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high\\ndistinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of\\nParliament, Mr. Kettle—\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his\\nname before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a\\nman, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.\\n\\nHESTER.  I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like\\nyourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are\\ninvited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord\\nBrancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she\\nwas married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t\\nbelieve she ran away more than once.\\n\\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady\\nHunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to\\nhave taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is\\nright in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,\\none never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not\\nconsidered the thing.\\n\\nHESTER.  In America those are the people we respect most.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I have no doubt of it.\\n\\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so\\nsincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come\\nacross.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young\\nlady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.\\nEnglish women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They\\nshow them then.\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young\\nman and a young girl?\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a\\ncushion_.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying\\nwhat a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful\\npower of selection.  It is quite a gift.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit\\nin very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will\\ncarry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.  [_To\\nFootman_.]  The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland.\\nGet the Shetland.  [_Exit Footman for shawl_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord\\nIllingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.  It\\nmeans a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear mother will be\\ndelighted.  I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.\\nDo you think she would, Gerald?  I know how difficult it is to get her to\\ngo anywhere.\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord\\nIllingworth had made me such an offer.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman with shawl_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come\\nup and meet him.  [_To Footman_.]  Just wait, Francis.  [_Writes\\nletter_.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as\\nyou are, Mr. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show\\nmyself worthy of it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I trust so.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ HESTER.]  _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss\\nWorsley.\\n\\nHESTER.  Are you very pleased about it?\\n\\nGERALD.  Of course I am.  It means everything to me—things that were out\\nof the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.\\n\\nHESTER.  Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.  Life is a hope.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord\\nIllingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that\\nmay not be true.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I don’t think that England should be represented abroad\\nby an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you are too\\nnervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I was in hopes he\\nwould have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he said her family was too\\nlarge.  Or was it her feet?  I forget which.  I regret it very much.  She\\nwas made to be an ambassador’s wife.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering\\npeople’s names, and forgetting their faces.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?  [_To\\nFootman_.]  Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a line to\\nyour dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she\\nreally must come to dinner.\\n\\n[_Exit Footman_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.  [_To_ HESTER.]\\nWill you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  With pleasure.  [_Exit with_ GERALD.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s good\\nfortune.  He is quite a _protégé_ of mine.  And I am particularly pleased\\nthat Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord\\nwithout my suggesting anything.  Nobody likes to be asked favours.  I\\nremember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season,\\nbecause she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to me.\\nIt was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking to be in\\nany respectable household.  I don’t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to\\nget rid of her.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that explains it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, the grass is too damp for you.  You had better go\\nand put on your overshoes at once.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You must allow me to be the best judge of that, John.\\nPray do as I tell you.\\n\\n[SIR JOHN _gets up and goes off_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!\\n\\n[_Enter_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\n[_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  Well, dear, I hope you like the park.  It is said\\nto be well timbered.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Quite, quite wonderful.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country\\nfor six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take\\nthe slightest notice of me.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I assure you, dear, that the country has not that\\neffect at all.  Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from\\nhere, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.  I remember the\\noccurrence perfectly.  Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of\\njoy, or gout.  I forget which.  We had a large party staying here at the\\ntime, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I think to elope is cowardly.  It’s running away from\\ndanger.  And danger has become so rare in modern life.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can make out, the young women of the present\\nday seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing\\nwith fire.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is\\nthat one never gets even singed.  It is the people who don’t know how to\\nplay with it who get burned up.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t know how the world would get on with such a\\ntheory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Ah!  The world was made for men and not for women.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Stutfield.  We have a much better\\ntime than they have.  There are far more things forbidden to us than are\\nforbidden to them.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; that is quite, quite true.  I had not thought of\\nthat.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?\\n\\nKELVIL.  I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.  It has\\nbeen an arduous task.  The demands on the time of a public man are very\\nheavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.  And I don’t think they meet with\\nadequate recognition.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, have you got your overshoes on?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Yes, my love.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think you had better come over here, John.  It is more\\nsheltered.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  You had better sit beside me.  [SIR\\nJOHN _rises and goes across_.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been writing about this morning, Mr.\\nKelvil?\\n\\nKELVIL.  On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield.  On Purity.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That must be such a very, very interesting thing to\\nwrite about.\\n\\nKELVIL.  It is the one subject of really national importance, nowadays,\\nLady Stutfield.  I purpose addressing my constituents on the question\\nbefore Parliament meets.  I find that the poorer classes of this country\\ndisplay a marked desire for a higher ethical standard.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How quite, quite nice of them.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Are you in favour of women taking part in politics, Mr.\\nKettle?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in\\nour political life, Lady Caroline.  Women are always on the side of\\nmorality, public and private.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It is so very, very gratifying to hear you say that.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes!—the moral qualities in women—that is the\\nimportant thing.  I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord Illingworth\\ndoesn’t value the moral qualities in women as much as he should.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, very\\nwicked.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  But what world says that, Lady Stutfield?  It must be\\nthe next world.  This world and I are on excellent terms.  [_Sits down\\nbeside_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Every one _I_ know says you are very, very wicked.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about,\\nnowadays, saying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely\\nand entirely true.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless, Lady\\nStutfield.  I have given up trying to reform him.  It would take a Public\\nCompany with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that.  But\\nyou have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth, haven’t you?  Gerald\\nArbuthnot has told us of his good fortune; it is really most kind of you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Hunstanton.  Kind is a\\ndreadful word.  I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I met\\nhim, and he’ll be of considerable use to me in something I am foolish\\nenough to think of doing.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  He is an admirable young man.  And his mother is one of\\nmy dearest friends.  He has just gone for a walk with our pretty\\nAmerican.  She is very pretty, is she not?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Far too pretty.  These American girls carry off all the\\ngood matches.  Why can’t they stay in their own country?  They are always\\ntelling us it is the Paradise of women.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is, Lady Caroline.  That is why, like Eve, they are\\nso extremely anxious to get out of it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Who are Miss Worsley’s parents?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American women are wonderfully clever in concealing\\ntheir parents.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean?  Miss\\nWorsley, Caroline, is an orphan.  Her father was a very wealthy\\nmillionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained my son\\nquite hospitably, when he visited Boston.  I don’t know how he made his\\nmoney, originally.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I fancy in American dry goods.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are American dry goods?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American novels.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How very singular! . . . Well, from whatever source her\\nlarge fortune came, I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley.  She dresses\\nexceedingly well.  All Americans do dress well.  They get their clothes\\nin Paris.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans die\\nthey go to Paris.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Indeed?  And when bad Americans die, where do they go\\nto?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, they go to America.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am afraid you don’t appreciate America, Lord Illingworth.  It\\nis a very remarkable country, especially considering its youth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The youth of America is their oldest tradition.  It\\nhas been going on now for three hundred years.  To hear them talk one\\nwould imagine they were in their first childhood.  As far as civilisation\\ngoes they are in their second.\\n\\nKELVIL.  There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in American\\npolitics.  I suppose you allude to that?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I wonder.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.  They\\ncertainly are in England.  Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country.  I\\nwonder Mrs. Cardew allows him.  I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don’t\\nthink that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I think they are the only people who should.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Do you take no side then in modern politics, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil.\\nTaking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows\\nshortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore.  However, the\\nHouse of Commons really does very little harm.  You can’t make people\\ngood by Act of Parliament,—that is something.\\n\\nKELVIL.  You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown great\\nsympathy with the sufferings of the poor.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is its special vice.  That is the special vice of\\nthe age.  One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of\\nlife.  The less said about life’s sores the better, Mr. Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Still our East End is a very important problem.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  It is the problem of slavery.  And we are\\ntrying to solve it by amusing the slaves.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, a great deal may be done by means of cheap\\nentertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth.  Dear Dr. Daubeny, our\\nrector here, provides, with the assistance of his curates, really\\nadmirable recreations for the poor during the winter.  And much good may\\nbe done by means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some popular\\namusement of that kind.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not at all in favour of amusements for the poor,\\nJane.  Blankets and coals are sufficient.  There is too much love of\\npleasure amongst the upper classes as it is.  Health is what we want in\\nmodern life.  The tone is not healthy, not healthy at all.\\n\\nKELVIL.  You are quite right, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I believe I am usually right.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Horrid word ‘health.’\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Silliest word in our language, and one knows so well\\nthe popular idea of health.  The English country gentleman galloping\\nafter a fox—the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.\\n\\nKELVIL.  May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House of Lords as\\na better institution than the House of Commons?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A much better institution, of course.  We in the House\\nof Lords are never in touch with public opinion.  That makes us a\\ncivilised body.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Are you serious in putting forward such a view?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\nVulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after one has\\ngiven them an idea, whether one is serious or not.  Nothing is serious\\nexcept passion.  The intellect is not a serious thing, and never has\\nbeen.  It is an instrument on which one plays, that is all.  The only\\nserious form of intellect I know is the British intellect.  And on the\\nBritish intellect the illiterates play the drum.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are you saying, Lord Illingworth, about the drum?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about the leading\\narticles in the London newspapers.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you believe all that is written in the\\nnewspapers?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do.  Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs.\\n[_Rises with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Are you going, Mrs. Allonby?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Just as far as the conservatory.  Lord Illingworth told me\\nthis morning that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven\\ndeadly sins.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind.  I will\\ncertainly speak to the gardener.\\n\\n[_Exit_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She lets her clever tongue run away with her sometimes.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows to run\\naway with her?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope so, Caroline, I am sure.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nDear Lord Alfred, do join us.  [LORD ALFRED _sits down beside_ LADY\\nSTUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You believe good of every one, Jane.  It is a great\\nfault.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, that one\\nshould believe evil of every one?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think it is much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield.\\nUntil, of course, people are found out to be good.  But that requires a\\ngreat deal of investigation nowadays.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But there is so much unkind scandal in modern life.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner that\\nthe basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant man, but he\\nseems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and purity\\nof life which is so important in this century.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, quite, quite important, is it not?\\n\\nKELVIL.  He gives me the impression of a man who does not appreciate the\\nbeauty of our English home-life.  I would say that he was tainted with\\nforeign ideas on the subject.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of home-life,\\nis there?\\n\\nKELVIL.  It is the mainstay of our moral system in England, Lady\\nStutfield.  Without it we would become like our neighbours.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That would be so, so sad, would it not?\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards woman simply as\\na toy.  Now, I have never regarded woman as a toy.  Woman is the\\nintellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life.  Without her\\nwe should forget the true ideals.  [_Sits down beside_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I am so very, very glad to hear you say that.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You a married man, Mr. Kettle?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, dear, Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am married, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Family?\\n\\nKELVIL.  Yes.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  How many?\\n\\nKELVIL.  Eight.\\n\\n[LADY STUTFIELD _turns her attention to_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at the\\nseaside?  [SIR JOHN _shrugs his shoulders_.]\\n\\nKELVIL.  My wife is at the seaside with the children, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You will join them later on, no doubt?\\n\\nKELVIL.  If my public engagements permit me.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Your public life must be a great source of gratification\\nto Mrs. Kettle.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_To_ LORD ALFRED.]  How very, very charming those\\ngold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord Alfred.\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  They are awfully expensive.  I can only afford them when\\nI’m in debt.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be in debt.\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  One must have some occupation nowadays.  If I hadn’t my\\ndebts I shouldn’t have anything to think about.  All the chaps I know are\\nin debt.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But don’t the people to whom you owe the money give you\\na great, great deal of annoyance?\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  Oh, no, they write; I don’t.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very strange.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs.\\nArbuthnot.  She won’t dine.  I am so sorry.  But she will come in the\\nevening.  I am very pleased indeed.  She is one of the sweetest of women.\\nWrites a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm.  [_Hands letter to_ LADY\\nCAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Looking at it_.]  A little lacking in femininity, Jane.\\nFemininity is the quality I admire most in women.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Taking back letter and leaving it on table_.]  Oh!\\nshe is very feminine, Caroline, and so good too.  You should hear what\\nthe Archdeacon says of her.  He regards her as his right hand in the\\nparish.  [_Footman speaks to her_.]  In the Yellow Drawing-room.  Shall\\nwe all go in?  Lady Stutfield, shall we go in to tea?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton.  [_They rise and proceed\\nto go off_.  SIR JOHN offers to carry LADY STUTFIELD’S cloak.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!  If you would allow your nephew to look after Lady\\nStutfield’s cloak, you might help me with my workbasket.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Certainly, my love.  [_Exeunt_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Curious thing, plain women are always jealous of their\\nhusbands, beautiful women never are!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Beautiful women never have time.  They are always so\\noccupied in being jealous of other people’s husbands.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should have thought Lady Caroline would have grown tired\\nof conjugal anxiety by this time!  Sir John is her fourth!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So much marriage is certainly not becoming.  Twenty\\nyears of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of\\nmarriage make her something like a public building.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Twenty years of romance!  Is there such a thing?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Not in our day.  Women have become too brilliant.\\nNothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Or the want of it in the man.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are quite right.  In a Temple every one should be\\nserious, except the thing that is worshipped.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And that should be man?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Women kneel so gracefully; men don’t.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for\\nthe last quarter of an hour.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Is she such a mystery?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is more than a mystery—she is a mood.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Moods don’t last.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is their chief charm.\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me, Lady\\nHunstanton and Lady Caroline, and . . . every one.  I hope I shall make a\\ngood secretary.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald.  [_Talks to\\nhim_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You enjoy country life, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  Very much indeed.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Don’t find yourself longing for a London dinner-party?\\n\\nHESTER.  I dislike London dinner-parties.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I adore them.  The clever people never listen, and the\\nstupid people never talk.\\n\\nHESTER.  I think the stupid people talk a great deal.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, I never listen!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy, if I didn’t like you I wouldn’t have made\\nyou the offer.  It is because I like you so much that I want to have you\\nwith me.\\n\\n[_Exit_ HESTER _with_ GERALD.]\\n\\nCharming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He is very nice; very nice indeed.  But I can’t stand the\\nAmerican young lady.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud voice too, that\\nshe was only eighteen.  It was most annoying.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never trust a woman who tells one her real\\nage.  A woman who would tell one that, would tell one anything.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She is a Puritan besides—\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah, that is inexcusable.  I don’t mind plain women\\nbeing Puritans.  It is the only excuse they have for being plain.  But\\nshe is decidedly pretty.  I admire her immensely.  [_Looks steadfastly\\nat_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a thoroughly bad man you must be!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you call a bad man?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The sort of man who admires innocence.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And a bad woman?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are severe—on yourself.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Define us as a sex.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Sphinxes without secrets.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Does that include the Puritan women?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do you know, I don’t believe in the existence of\\nPuritan women?  I don’t think there is a woman in the world who would not\\nbe a little flattered if one made love to her.  It is that which makes\\nwomen so irresistibly adorable.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You think there is no woman in the world who would object\\nto being kissed?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Very few.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you sure?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Quite.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you think she’d do if I kissed her?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her\\nglove.  What would you do if she struck you across the face with her\\nglove?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Fall in love with her, probably.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Is that a challenge?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is an arrow shot into the air.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t you know that I always succeed in whatever I\\ntry?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I am sorry to hear it.  We women adore failures.  They\\nlean on us.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You worship successes.  You cling to them.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We are the laurels to hide their baldness.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And they need you always, except at the moment of\\ntriumph.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They are uninteresting then.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How tantalising you are!  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like\\nyou for.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only one thing?  And I have so many bad qualities.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, don’t be too conceited about them.  You may lose them\\nas you grow old.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I never intend to grow old.  The soul is born old but\\ngrows young.  That is the comedy of life.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And the body is born young and grows old.  That is life’s\\ntragedy.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Its comedy also, sometimes.  But what is the\\nmysterious reason why you will always like me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is that you have never made love to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have never done anything else.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Really?  I have not noticed it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How fortunate!  It might have been a tragedy for both\\nof us.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We should each have survived.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One can survive everything nowadays, except death, and\\nlive down anything except a good reputation.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Have you tried a good reputation?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of the many annoyances to which I have never\\nbeen subjected.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It may come.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why do you threaten me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nFRANCIS.  Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Tell her ladyship we are coming in.\\n\\nFRANCIS.  Yes, my lord.\\n\\n[_Exit_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Shall we go in to tea?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you like such simple pleasures?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I adore simple pleasures.  They are the last refuge of\\nthe complex.  But, if you wish, let us stay here.  Yes, let us stay here.\\nThe Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It ends with Revelations.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You fence divinely.  But the button has come of your\\nfoil.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I have still the mask.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It makes your eyes lovelier.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Thank you.  Come.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT’S _letter on table_, _and takes\\nit up and looks at envelope_.]  What a curious handwriting!  It reminds\\nme of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Who?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! no one.  No one in particular.  A woman of no\\nimportance.  [_Throws letter down_, _and passes up the steps of the\\nterrace with_ MRS. ALLONBY.  _They smile at each other_.]\\n\\n                                ACT DROP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSECOND ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.\\n                               _Door_ R.C.\\n\\n[_Ladies seated on sofas_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a\\nlittle!\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly\\nhappy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to\\nleave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing\\nspace after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be\\nabsolutely worn to shadows.\\n\\n[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up\\nto the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to\\nescape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their\\npower and use it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense\\nall this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper\\nplace.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re\\nnot married?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a\\nwife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going\\nabout society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry\\nwithin twelve months.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they’re in love with some\\none who, perhaps, is tied to another?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off\\nin a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to\\nmeddle with other people’s property.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other\\npeople’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the\\nonly true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we\\ndon’t belong to any one.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you really think, dear Caroline, that\\nlegislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,\\nall the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like\\nmarried men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I certainly never know one from the other.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man\\nhas home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad\\nexpression in the eyes of so many married men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly\\ntedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they\\nare not.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely\\nchanged since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor dear\\nHunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I’m tired of\\nmeeting him.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you renew him from time to time, don’t you?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh no, Lady Caroline.  I have only had one husband as yet.\\nI suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  With your views on life I wonder you married at all.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  So do I.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, I believe you are really very happy in\\nyour married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from others.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, I hope not, dear.  I knew his mother quite well.\\nShe was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland’s daughters.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Victoria Stratton?  I remember her perfectly.  A silly\\nfair-haired woman with no chin.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, Ernest has a chin.  He has a very strong chin, a\\nsquare chin.  Ernest’s chin is far too square.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But do you really think a man’s chin can be too square?\\nI think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be\\nquite, quite square.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield.  It\\nis only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I adore silent men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Ernest isn’t silent.  He talks the whole time.  But he\\nhas got no conversation.  What he talks about I don’t know.  I haven’t\\nlistened to him for years.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Have you never forgiven him then?  How sad that seems!\\nBut all life is very, very sad, is it not?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a _mauvais quart d’heure_\\nmade up of exquisite moments.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, there are moments, certainly.  But was it something\\nvery, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did?  Did he become angry with you, and\\nsay anything that was unkind or true?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh dear, no.  Ernest is invariably calm.  That is one of\\nthe reasons he always gets on my nerves.  Nothing is so aggravating as\\ncalmness.  There is something positively brutal about the good temper of\\nmost modern men.  I wonder we women stand it as well as we do.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men’s good temper shows they are not so sensitive\\nas we are, not so finely strung.  It makes a great barrier often between\\nhusband and wife, does it not?  But I would so much like to know what was\\nthe wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell\\neverybody else.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  I will make a point of repeating\\nit.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively\\non his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course\\nof his life.  I was very young at the time, so I didn’t believe him, I\\nneedn’t tell you.  Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any\\nkind till after I had been actually married four or five months.  I found\\nout then that what he had told me was perfectly true.  And that sort of\\nthing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Men always want to be a woman’s first love.  That is their\\nclumsy vanity.  We women have a more subtle instinct about things.  What\\nwe like is to be a man’s last romance.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I see what you mean.  It’s very, very beautiful.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, you don’t mean to tell me that you won’t\\nforgive your husband because he never loved any one else?  Did you ever\\nhear such a thing, Caroline?  I am quite surprised.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that\\nnothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages.  They\\napparently are getting remarkably rare.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, they’re quite out of date.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  How like the middle classes!\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes—is it not?—very, very like them.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  If what you tell us about the middle classes is true,\\nLady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit.  It is much to be\\nregretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently\\nfrivolous, under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to\\nbe.  It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we\\nall know of in society.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don’t think the frivolity of\\nthe wife has ever anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined\\nnowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else.  How\\ncan a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating\\nher as if she were a perfectly rational being?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a\\nsex that has been rational for millions and millions of years.  He can’t\\nhelp himself.  It is in his race.  The History of Woman is very\\ndifferent.  We have always been picturesque protests against the mere\\nexistence of common sense.  We saw its dangers from the first.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly most,\\nmost trying.  Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband.  I think\\nit would be so very, very helpful.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Husband?  There couldn’t be such a thing.  The\\ninstitution is wrong.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to _us_.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  He would probably be extremely realistic.\\n\\nMRS. CAROLINE.  The Ideal Man!  Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if\\nwe were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.  He should refuse\\nall our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims.  He should\\nencourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions.  He should\\nalways say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he\\nsays.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But how could he do both, dear?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should never run down other pretty women.  That would\\nshow he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much.  No; he\\nshould be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don’t attract\\nhim.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about\\nother women.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us\\nan answer all about ourselves.  He should invariably praise us for\\nwhatever qualities he knows we haven’t got.  But he should be pitiless,\\nquite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never\\ndreamed of possessing.  He should never believe that we know the use of\\nuseful things.  That would be unforgiveable.  But he should shower on us\\neverything we don’t want.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills\\nand compliments.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat\\nus with absolute respect when we are alone.  And yet he should be always\\nready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to\\nbecome miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment’s notice, and to\\noverwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be\\npositively violent at the end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever\\nat a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner.  And\\nwhen, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has\\nrefused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised\\nnever to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters,\\nhe should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long,\\nand send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine\\nquite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he\\nwas.  And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about\\neverywhere with one’s husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one\\nwas, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if\\nhis conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really\\nbadly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in\\nthe wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman’s duty to\\nforgive, and one can do it all over again from the beginning, with\\nvariations.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How clever you are, my dear!  You never mean a single\\nword you say.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  It has been quite, quite\\nentrancing.  I must try and remember it all.  There are such a number of\\ndetails that are so very, very important.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you have not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal\\nMan is to be.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  His reward?  Oh, infinite expectation.  That is quite\\nenough for him.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But men are so terribly, terribly exacting, are they\\nnot?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  That makes no matter.  One should never surrender.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Not even to the Ideal Man?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Certainly not to him.  Unless, of course, one wants to\\ngrow tired of him.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh! . . . yes.  I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\\nDo you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?  Or are\\nthere more than one?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, my dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Going over to her_.]  What has happened?  Do tell me.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_in a low voice_]  I had completely forgotten that the\\nAmerican young lady has been in the room all the time.  I am afraid some\\nof this clever talk may have shocked her a little.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that will do her so much good!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Let us hope she didn’t understand much.  I think I had\\nbetter go over and talk to her.  [_Rises and goes across to_ HESTER\\nWORSLEY.]  Well, dear Miss Worsley. [_Sitting down beside her_.]  How\\nquiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time!  I suppose\\nyou have been reading a book?  There are so many books here in the\\nlibrary.\\n\\nHESTER.  No, I have been listening to the conversation.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You mustn’t believe everything that was said, you know,\\ndear.\\n\\nHESTER.  I didn’t believe any of it\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That is quite right, dear.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Continuing_.]  I couldn’t believe that any women could really\\nhold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your\\nguests.  [_An awkward pause_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hear you have such pleasant society in America.\\nQuite like our own in places, my son wrote to me.\\n\\nHESTER.  There are cliques in America as elsewhere, Lady Hunstanton.  But\\ntrue American society consists simply of all the good women and good men\\nwe have in our country.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What a sensible system, and I dare say quite pleasant\\ntoo.  I am afraid in England we have too many artificial social barriers.\\nWe don’t see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes.\\n\\nHESTER.  In America we have no lower classes.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a very strange arrangement!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What is that dreadful girl talking about?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  She is painfully natural, is she not?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  There are a great many things you haven’t got in America,\\nI am told, Miss Worsley.  They say you have no ruins, and no curiosities.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_To_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  What nonsense!  They have their\\nmothers and their manners.\\n\\nHESTER.  The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities, Lady\\nCaroline.  They are sent over to us every summer, regularly, in the\\nsteamers, and propose to us the day after they land.  As for ruins, we\\nare trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or\\nstone.  [_Gets up to take her fan from table_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What is that, dear?  Ah, yes, an iron Exhibition, is it\\nnot, at that place that has the curious name?\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Standing by table_.]  We are trying to build up life, Lady\\nHunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests on here.\\nThis sounds strange to you all, no doubt.  How could it sound other than\\nstrange?  You rich people in England, you don’t know how you are living.\\nHow could you know?  You shut out from your society the gentle and the\\ngood.  You laugh at the simple and the pure.  Living, as you all do, on\\nothers and by them, you sneer at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread\\nto the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season.  With all your\\npomp and wealth and art you don’t know how to live—you don’t even know\\nthat.  You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the\\nbeauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of\\nlife, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing.  You have\\nlost life’s secret.  Oh, your English society seems to me shallow,\\nselfish, foolish.  It has blinded its eyes, and stopped its ears.  It\\nlies like a leper in purple.  It sits like a dead thing smeared with\\ngold.  It is all wrong, all wrong.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I don’t think one should know of these things.  It is\\nnot very, very nice, is it?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English\\nsociety so much.  You were such a success in it.  And you were so much\\nadmired by the best people.  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said\\nof you—but it was most complimentary, and you know what an authority he\\nis on beauty.\\n\\nHESTER.  Lord Henry Weston!  I remember him, Lady Hunstanton.  A man with\\na hideous smile and a hideous past.  He is asked everywhere.  No\\ndinner-party is complete without him.  What of those whose ruin is due to\\nhim?  They are outcasts.  They are nameless.  If you met them in the\\nstreet you would turn your head away.  I don’t complain of their\\npunishment.  Let all women who have sinned be punished.\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters from terrace behind in a cloak with a lace veil\\nover her head_.  _She hears the last words and starts_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady!\\n\\nHESTER.  It is right that they should be punished, but don’t let them be\\nthe only ones to suffer.  If a man and woman have sinned, let them both\\ngo forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there.  Let them\\nboth be branded.  Set a mark, if you wish, on each, but don’t punish the\\none and let the other go free.  Don’t have one law for men and another\\nfor women.  You are unjust to women in England.  And till you count what\\nis a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man, you will always be\\nunjust, and Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of cloud,\\nwill be made dim to your eyes, or be not seen at all, or if seen, not\\nregarded.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Might I, dear Miss Worsley, as you are standing up, ask\\nyou for my cotton that is just behind you?  Thank you.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Mrs. Arbuthnot!  I am so pleased you have come\\nup.  But I didn’t hear you announced.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, I came straight in from the terrace, Lady Hunstanton,\\njust as I was.  You didn’t tell me you had a party.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Not a party.  Only a few guests who are staying in the\\nhouse, and whom you must know.  Allow me.  [_Tries to help her_.  _Rings\\nbell_.]  Caroline, this is Mrs. Arbuthnot, one of my sweetest friends.\\nLady Caroline Pontefract, Lady Stutfield, Mrs. Allonby, and my young\\nAmerican friend, Miss Worsley, who has just been telling us all how\\nwicked we are.\\n\\nHESTER.  I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly, Lady Hunstanton.\\nBut there are some things in England—\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth, I\\ndare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it,\\nwhich is much more important, Lord Illingworth would tell us.  The only\\npoint where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady Caroline’s\\nbrother, about poor Lord Henry.  He is really such good company.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nTake Mrs. Arbuthnot’s things.\\n\\n[_Exit Footman with wraps_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  Lady Caroline, I had no idea it was your brother.  I am sorry\\nfor the pain I must have caused you—I—\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  My dear Miss Worsley, the only part of your little\\nspeech, if I may so term it, with which I thoroughly agreed, was the part\\nabout my brother.  Nothing that you could possibly say could be too bad\\nfor him.  I regard Henry as infamous, absolutely infamous.  But I am\\nbound to state, as you were remarking, Jane, that he is excellent\\ncompany, and he has one of the best cooks in London, and after a good\\ndinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relations.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_to_ MISS WORSLEY]  Now, do come, dear, and make friends\\nwith Mrs. Arbuthnot.  She is one of the good, sweet, simple people you\\ntold us we never admitted into society.  I am sorry to say Mrs. Arbuthnot\\ncomes very rarely to me.  But that is not my fault.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a bore it is the men staying so long after dinner!  I\\nexpect they are saying the most dreadful things about us.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really think so?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I was sure of it.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very horrid of them!  Shall we go onto the\\nterrace?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, anything to get away from the dowagers and the\\ndowdies.  [_Rises and goes with_ LADY STUTFIELD _to door_ L.C.]  We are\\nonly going to look at the stars, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You will find a great many, dear, a great many.  But\\ndon’t catch cold.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  We shall all miss Gerald so\\nmuch, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But has Lord Illingworth really offered to make Gerald\\nhis secretary?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, yes!  He has been most charming about it.  He has\\nthe highest possible opinion of your boy.  You don’t know Lord\\nIllingworth, I believe, dear.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have never met him.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You know him by name, no doubt?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am afraid I don’t.  I live so much out of the world,\\nand see so few people.  I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord\\nIllingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes.  That would be the last Earl but one.  He was\\na very curious man.  He wanted to marry beneath him.  Or wouldn’t, I\\nbelieve.  There was some scandal about it.  The present Lord Illingworth\\nis quite different.  He is very distinguished.  He does—well, he does\\nnothing, which I am afraid our pretty American visitor here thinks very\\nwrong of anybody, and I don’t know that he cares much for the subjects in\\nwhich you are so interested, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Do you think,\\nCaroline, that Lord Illingworth is interested in the Housing of the Poor?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I should fancy not at all, Jane.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  We all have our different tastes, have we not?  But\\nLord Illingworth has a very high position, and there is nothing he\\ncouldn’t get if he chose to ask for it.  Of course, he is comparatively a\\nyoung man still, and he has only come to his title within—how long\\nexactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworth succeeded?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  About four years, I think, Jane.  I know it was the same\\nyear in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I remember.  That would be about four years ago.\\nOf course, there were a great many people between the present Lord\\nIllingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  There was—who was there,\\nCaroline?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  There was poor Margaret’s baby.  You remember how anxious\\nshe was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and her husband\\ndied shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of Lord\\nAscot’s sons, who, I am told, beats her.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the family.\\nAnd there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic,\\nor a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know the\\nCourt of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that he was quite\\nsane.  And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumstead’s with straws in\\nhis hair, or something very odd about him.  I can’t recall what.  I often\\nregret, Lady Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son\\nget the title.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Cecilia?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Lord Illingworth’s mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, was one\\nof the Duchess of Jerningham’s pretty daughters, and she married Sir\\nThomas Harford, who wasn’t considered a very good match for her at the\\ntime, though he was said to be the handsomest man in London.  I knew them\\nall quite intimately, and both the sons, Arthur and George.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course, Lady\\nHunstanton?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field.  Or was\\nit fishing, Caroline?  I forget.  But George came in for everything.  I\\nalways tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has\\nhad.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once.\\nMight I see him?  Can he be sent for?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, dear.  I will send one of the servants into\\nthe dining-room to fetch him.  I don’t know what keeps the gentlemen so\\nlong.  [_Rings bell_.]  When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain\\nGeorge Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young man about town, with\\nnot a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him.  She\\nwas quite devoted to him.  Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms\\nwith his father.  Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon.  [_To Servant_.]  It\\ndoesn’t matter.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ DOCTOR DAUBENY.  SIR JOHN _goes over to_ LADY\\nSTUTFIELD, DOCTOR DAUBENY _to_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining.  I have\\nnever enjoyed myself more.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_To_ DOCTOR BAUBENY.]  You see I have got Mrs.\\nArbuthnot to come to me at last.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton.  Mrs. Daubeny\\nwill be quite jealous of you.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come with you\\nto-night.  Headache as usual, I suppose.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.  But she is\\nhappiest alone.  She is happiest alone.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_To her husband_.]  John!  [SIR JOHN _goes over to his\\nwife_.  DOCTOR BAUBENY _talks to_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT watches LORD ILLINGWORTH the whole time.  He has passed\\nacross the room without noticing her, and approaches MRS. ALLONBY, who\\nwith LADY STUTFIELD is standing by the door looking on to the terrace.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How is the most charming woman in the world?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [Taking LADY STUTFIELD by the hand.]  We are both quite\\nwell, thank you, Lord Illingworth.  But what a short time you have been\\nin the dining-room!  It seems as if we had only just left.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was bored to death.  Never opened my lips the whole\\ntime.  Absolutely longing to come in to you.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You should have.  The American girl has been giving us a\\nlecture.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Really?  All Americans lecture, I believe.  I suppose\\nit is something in their climate.  What did she lecture about?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Puritanism, of course.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am going to convert her, am I not?  How long do you\\ngive me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  A week.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A week is more than enough.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Going to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Dear mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, I don’t feel at all well.  See me home, Gerald.\\nI shouldn’t have come.\\n\\nGERALD.  I am so sorry, mother.  Certainly.  But you must know Lord\\nIllingworth first.  [_Goes across room_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Not to-night, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know my mother.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  With the greatest pleasure.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\nI’ll be back in a moment.  People’s mothers always bore me to death.  All\\nwomen become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  No man does.  That is his.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a delightful mood you are in to-night!  [_Turns\\nround and goes across with_ GERALD _to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  _When he sees\\nher_, _he starts back in wonder_.  _Then slowly his eyes turn towards_\\nGERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has offered to take me as\\nhis private secretary.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _bows coldly_.]  It is a\\nwonderful opening for me, isn’t it?  I hope he won’t be disappointed in\\nme, that is all.  You’ll thank Lord Illingworth, mother, won’t you?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth in very good, I am sure, to interest\\nhimself in you for the moment.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Putting his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  Oh,\\nGerald and I are great friends already, Mrs . . . Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There can be nothing in common between you and my son,\\nLord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, how can you say so?  Of course Lord Illingworth is\\nawfully clever and that sort of thing.  There is nothing Lord Illingworth\\ndoesn’t know.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy!\\n\\nGERALD.  He knows more about life than any one I have ever met.  I feel\\nan awful duffer when I am with you, Lord Illingworth.  Of course, I have\\nhad so few advantages.  I have not been to Eton or Oxford like other\\nchaps.  But Lord Illingworth doesn’t seem to mind that.  He has been\\nawfully good to me, mother.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth may change his mind.  He may not really\\nwant you as his secretary.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You must remember, as you said yourself, you have had so\\nfew advantages.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for a moment.  Do\\ncome over.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Will you excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot?  Now, don’t let\\nyour charming mother make any more difficulties, Gerald.  The thing is\\nquite settled, isn’t it?\\n\\nGERALD.  I hope so.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _goes across to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I thought you were never going to leave the lady in black\\nvelvet.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is excessively handsome.  [_Looks at_ MRS.\\nARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room?\\nMiss Worsley is going to play.  You’ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,\\nwon’t you?  You don’t know what a treat is in store for you.  [_To_\\nDOCTOR BAUBENY.]  I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to\\nthe rectory.  I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the\\nviolin.  Ah, I forgot.  Dear Mrs. Daubeny’s hearing is a little\\ndefective, is it not?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Her deafness is a great privation to her.  She can’t\\neven hear my sermons now.  She reads them at home.  But she has many\\nresources in herself, many resources.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She reads a good deal, I suppose?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Just the very largest print.  The eyesight is rapidly\\ngoing.  But she’s never morbid, never morbid.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  Do speak to my mother, Lord\\nIllingworth, before you go into the music-room.  She seems to think,\\nsomehow, you don’t mean what you said to me.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Aren’t you coming?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  In a few moments.  Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot\\nwould allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join\\nyou later on.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, of course.  You will have a great deal to say to\\nher, and she will have a great deal to thank you for.  It is not every\\nson who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  But I know you appreciate\\nthat, dear.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, don’t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord\\nIllingworth.  We can’t spare her.\\n\\n[_Exit following the other guests_.  _Sound of violin heard from\\nmusic-room_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So that is our son, Rachel!  Well, I am very proud of\\nhim.  He in a Harford, every inch of him.  By the way, why Arbuthnot,\\nRachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  One name is as good as another, when one has no right to\\nany name.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose so—but why Gerald?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  After a man whose heart I broke—after my father.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Well, Rachel, what in over is over.  All I have got to\\nsay now in that I am very, very much pleased with our boy.  The world\\nwill know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will be\\nsomething very near, and very dear.  It is a curious thing, Rachel; my\\nlife seemed to be quite complete.  It was not so.  It lacked something,\\nit lacked a son.  I have found my son now, I am glad I have found him.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You have no right to claim him, or the smallest part of\\nhim.  The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over\\ntwenty years.  Why not let me have him for a little now?  He is quite as\\nmuch mine as yours.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Are you talking of the child you abandoned?  Of the\\nchild who, as far as you are concerned, might have died of hunger and of\\nwant?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me.  It was\\nnot I who left you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I left you because you refused to give the child a name.\\nBefore my son was born, I implored you to marry me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I had no expectations then.  And besides, Rachel, I\\nwasn’t much older than you were.  I was only twenty-two.  I was\\ntwenty-one, I believe, when the whole thing began in your father’s\\ngarden.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old\\nenough to do right also.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities are always\\ninteresting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.  As for\\nsaying I left our child to starve, that, of course, is untrue and silly.\\nMy mother offered you six hundred a year.  But you wouldn’t take\\nanything.  You simply disappeared, and carried the child away with you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I wouldn’t have accepted a penny from her.  Your father\\nwas different.  He told you, in my presence, when we were in Paris, that\\nit was your duty to marry me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, duty is what one expects from others, it is not\\nwhat one does oneself.  Of course, I was influenced by my mother.  Every\\nman is when he is young.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am glad to hear you say so.  Gerald shall certainly\\nnot go away with you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What nonsense, Rachel!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Do you think I would allow my son—\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  _Our_ son.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son [LORD ILLINGWORTH _shrugs his shoulders_]—to go\\naway with the man who spoiled my youth, who ruined my life, who has\\ntainted every moment of my days?  You don’t realise what my past has been\\nin suffering and in shame.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, I must candidly say that I think\\nGerald’s future considerably more important than your past.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald cannot separate his future from my past.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is exactly what he should do.  That is exactly\\nwhat you should help him to do.  What a typical woman you are!  You talk\\nsentimentally, and you are thoroughly selfish the whole time.  But don’t\\nlet us have a scene.  Rachel, I want you to look at this matter from the\\ncommon-sense point of view, from the point of view of what is best for\\nour son, leaving you and me out of the question.  What is our son at\\npresent?  An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank in a third-rate\\nEnglish town.  If you imagine he is quite happy in such a position, you\\nare mistaken.  He is thoroughly discontented.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He was not discontented till he met you.  You have made\\nhim so.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Of course, I made him so.  Discontent is the first\\nstep in the progress of a man or a nation.  But I did not leave him with\\na mere longing for things he could not get.  No, I made him a charming\\noffer.  He jumped at it, I need hardly say.  Any young man would.  And\\nnow, simply because it turns out that I am the boy’s own father and he my\\nown son, you propose practically to ruin his career.  That is to say, if\\nI were a perfect stranger, you would allow Gerald to go away with me, but\\nas he is my own flesh and blood you won’t.  How utterly illogical you\\nare!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not allow him to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How can you prevent it?  What excuse can you give to\\nhim for making him decline such an offer as mine?  I won’t tell him in\\nwhat relations I stand to him, I need hardly say.  But you daren’t tell\\nhim.  You know that.  Look how you have brought him up.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have brought him up to be a good man.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  And what is the result?  You have educated\\nhim to be your judge if he ever finds you out.  And a bitter, an unjust\\njudge he will be to you.  Don’t be deceived, Rachel.  Children begin by\\nloving their parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely, if ever, do\\nthey forgive them.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  George, don’t take my son away from me.  I have had\\ntwenty years of sorrow, and I have only had one thing to love me, only\\none thing to love.  You have had a life of joy, and pleasure, and\\nsuccess.  You have been quite happy, you have never thought of us.  There\\nwas no reason, according to your views of life, why you should have\\nremembered us at all.  Your meeting us was a mere accident, a horrible\\naccident.  Forget it.  Don’t come now, and rob me of . . . of all I have\\nin the whole world.  You are so rich in other things.  Leave me the\\nlittle vineyard of my life; leave me the walled-in garden and the well of\\nwater; the ewe-lamb God sent me, in pity or in wrath, oh! leave me that.\\nGeorge, don’t take Gerald from me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, at the present moment you are not necessary to\\nGerald’s career; I am.  There is nothing more to be said on the subject.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not let him go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Here is Gerald.  He has a right to decide for himself.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother, I hope you have settled it all with Lord\\nIllingworth?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have not, Gerald.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother seems not to like your coming with me, for\\nsome reason.\\n\\nGERALD.  Why, mother?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I thought you were quite happy here with me, Gerald.  I\\ndidn’t know you were so anxious to leave me.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, how can you talk like that?  Of course I have been quite\\nhappy with you.  But a man can’t stay always with his mother.  No chap\\ndoes.  I want to make myself a position, to do something.  I thought you\\nwould have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth’s secretary.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not think you would be suitable as a private\\nsecretary to Lord Illingworth.  You have no qualifications.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs.\\nArbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I surely am\\nthe best judge.  And I can only tell you that your son has all the\\nqualifications I had hoped for.  He has more, in fact, than I had even\\nthought of.  Far more.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _remains silent_.]  Have you any\\nother reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don’t wish your son to accept this\\npost?\\n\\nGERALD.  Have you, mother?  Do answer.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.  We\\nare quite by ourselves here.  Whatever it is, I need not say I will not\\nrepeat it.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you would like to be alone with your son, I will\\nleave you.  You may have some other reason you don’t wish me to hear.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have no other reason.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing as\\nsettled.  Come, you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together.\\nAnd Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I think you have acted\\nvery, very wisely.\\n\\n[_Exit with_ GERALD.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is left alone_.  _She stands\\nimmobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face_.]\\n\\n                                 ACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHIRD ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n    _The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_.  _Door at back leading on to\\n                                terrace_.\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a\\nsofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I\\nknew she would come round in the end.\\n\\nGERALD.  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know\\nshe doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is\\nperfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I\\ncouldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value\\nwhatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is\\nnot a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.\\n\\nGERALD.  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on\\nyour side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing\\nlike youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in\\nlife’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom\\nwaiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,\\nlike most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I\\nwouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of\\nthe community.\\n\\nGERALD.  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.\\nI sometimes think she must have married beneath her.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts\\nhis hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father,\\nI suppose, Gerald?\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such\\na mother as I have had.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that\\nmost mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,\\nthat a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.\\nAfter all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such\\na hole as Wrockley, could you?\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is\\noften curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in\\nit.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Slowly_.]  I suppose there is.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good\\nwomen have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their\\ninterests are so petty, aren’t they?\\n\\nGERALD.  They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care\\nmuch about.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort\\nof thing.\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, yes, she’s always going to church.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only\\nthing worth being nowadays.  You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?\\nYou want to know life as it really is.  Not to be put of with any\\nold-fashioned theories about life.  Well, what you have to do at present\\nis simply to fit yourself for the best society.  A man who can dominate a\\nLondon dinner-table can dominate the world.  The future belongs to the\\ndandy.  It is the exquisites who are going to rule.\\n\\nGERALD.  I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always\\nbeen told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that\\nthey don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial.  By the way,\\nGerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.  Sentiment is all\\nvery well for the button-hole.  But the essential thing for a necktie is\\nstyle.  A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Laughing_.]  I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord\\nIllingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know\\nhow to talk.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to\\nevery man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you\\nwill have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.\\n\\nGERALD.  But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either\\nto feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!\\n\\nGERALD.  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of it\\nsimply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any real\\nsuccess in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule\\nsociety.  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.  You\\nmight just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at\\nonce.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You should never try to understand them.  Women are\\npictures.  Men are problems.  If you want to know what a woman really\\nmeans—which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do—look at her,\\ndon’t listen to her.\\n\\nGERALD.  But women are awfully clever, aren’t they?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always tell them so.  But, to the\\nphilosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over\\nmind—just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.\\n\\nGERALD.  How then can women have so much power as you say they have?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The history of women is the history of the worst form\\nof tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak over the\\nstrong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.\\n\\nGERALD.  But haven’t women got a refining influence?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Nothing refines but the intellect.\\n\\nGERALD.  Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren’t there?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.\\n\\nGERALD.  But there are good women in society, aren’t there?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Far too many.\\n\\nGERALD.  But do you think women shouldn’t be good?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never tell them so, they’d all become good\\nat once.  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.  Every woman is a rebel,\\nand usually in wild revolt against herself.\\n\\nGERALD.  You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Men marry because they are tired; women because they\\nare curious.  Both are disappointed.\\n\\nGERALD.  But don’t you think one can be happy when one is married?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Perfectly happy.  But the happiness of a married man,\\nmy dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.\\n\\nGERALD.  But if one is in love?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always be in love.  That is the reason one\\nshould never marry.\\n\\nGERALD.  Love is a very wonderful thing, isn’t it?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself.\\nAnd one ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a\\nromance.  But a really _grande passion_ is comparatively rare nowadays.\\nIt is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.  That is the one\\nuse of the idle classes in a country, and the only possible explanation\\nof us Harfords.\\n\\nGERALD.  Harfords, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is my family name.  You should study the Peerage,\\nGerald.  It is the one book a young man about town should know\\nthoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever\\ndone.  And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectly new life with me,\\nand I want you to know how to live.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _appears on terrace\\nbehind_.]  For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live\\nin it!\\n\\n[_Enter_ L.C. LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ DR. DAUBENY.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! here you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  Well, I\\nsuppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new\\nduties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good advice over a\\npleasant cigarette.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady\\nHunstanton, and the best of cigarettes.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I\\nsuppose I am too old now to learn.  Except from you, dear Archdeacon,\\nwhen you are in your nice pulpit.  But then I always know what you are\\ngoing to say, so I don’t feel alarmed.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah!\\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.  Come, dear.  [_Enter_ MRS.\\nARBUTHNOT.]  Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord\\nIllingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant\\nway in which everything has turned out for him.  Let us sit down.  [_They\\nsit down_.]  And how is your beautiful embroidery going on?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn’t she?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas.\\nBut the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal.  She has not touched\\nthe tambour frame for nine or ten years.  But she has many other\\namusements.  She is very much interested in her own health.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that is always a nice distraction, in it not?  Now,\\nwhat are you talking about, Lord Illingworth?  Do tell us.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the\\nworld has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in\\nwhich it has been able to bear them.  And that, consequently, whatever\\nthe world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now I am quite out of my depth.  I usually am when Lord\\nIllingworth says anything.  And the Humane Society is most careless.\\nThey never rescue me.  I am left to sink.  I have a dim idea, dear Lord\\nIllingworth, that you are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I\\nalways try to be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get.\\nAnd after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The only difference between the saint and the sinner\\nis that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that quite does for me.  I haven’t a word to say.\\nYou and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age.  We can’t follow Lord\\nIllingworth.  Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid.\\nTo have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays.  It shuts one\\nout from so much.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of\\nhis opinions.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are quite right, dear.\\n\\n[GERALD _shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother_.\\n_Enter_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Jane, have you seen John anywhere?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You needn’t be anxious about him, dear.  He is with\\nLady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room.\\nThey seem quite happy together.  You are not going, Caroline?  Pray sit\\ndown.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think I had better look after John.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It doesn’t do to pay men so much attention.  And\\nCaroline has really nothing to be anxious about.  Lady Stutfield is very\\nsympathetic.  She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about\\nanother.  A beautiful nature.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nAh! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs. Allonby too!  I suppose it was Mrs.\\nAllonby I saw him with.  Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere\\nfor you.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady\\nHunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! the Music-room, of course.  I thought it was the\\nYellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.  [_To the_\\nARCHDEACON.]  Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn’t she?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She used to be quite remarkable for her memory, but\\nsince her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early\\nchildhood.  But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great\\npleasure.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY STUTFIELD _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil been\\ntalking to you about?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Bimetallism!  Is that quite a nice subject?  However, I\\nknow people discuss everything very freely nowadays.  What did Sir John\\ntalk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  About Patagonia.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a remote topic!  But very improving, I\\nhave no doubt.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia.\\nSavages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost\\nall subjects.  They are excessively advanced.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What do they do?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Apparently everything.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it\\nnot, to find that Human Nature is permanently one.—On the whole, the\\nworld is the same world, is it not?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The world is simply divided into two classes—those who\\nbelieve the incredible, like the public—and those who do the improbable—\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Like yourself?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Yes; I am always astonishing myself.  It is the only\\nthing that makes life worth living.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful\\nqualities in my own nature.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah! don’t become quite perfect all at once.  Do it\\ngradually!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t intend to grow perfect at all.  At least, I\\nhope I shan’t.  It would be most inconvenient.  Women love us for our\\ndefects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything,\\neven our gigantic intellects.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis.  We forgive\\nadoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from us.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.  _He joins_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn’t we,\\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot?  I am sure you agree with me in that.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many\\nthings women should never forgive.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What sort of things?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The ruin of another woman’s life.\\n\\n[_Moves slowly away to back of stage_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe\\nthere are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and\\nreformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take\\nthings very, very easily.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is\\nunbecoming.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of\\nbeing terribly, terribly deceived.\\n\\nKELVIL.  The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  There is no secret of life.  Life’s aim, if it has\\none, is simply to be always looking for temptations.  There are not\\nnearly enough.  I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a\\nsingle one.  It is quite dreadful.  It makes one so nervous about the\\nfuture.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Shakes her fan at him_.]  I don’t know how it is,\\ndear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me\\nexcessively immoral.  It has been most interesting, listening to you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  All thought is immoral.  Its very essence is\\ndestruction.  If you think of anything, you kill it.  Nothing survives\\nbeing thought of.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t understand a word, Lord Illingworth.  But I\\nhave no doubt it is all quite true.  Personally, I have very little to\\nreproach myself with, on the score of thinking.  I don’t believe in women\\nthinking too much.  Women should think in moderation, as they should do\\nall things in moderation.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.  Nothing\\nsucceeds like excess.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope I shall remember that.  It sounds an admirable\\nmaxim.  But I’m beginning to forget everything.  It’s a great misfortune.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady\\nHunstanton.  No woman should have a memory.  Memory in a woman is the\\nbeginning of dowdiness.  One can always tell from a woman’s bonnet\\nwhether she has got a memory or not.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  You\\nalways find out that one’s most glaring fault is one’s most important\\nvirtue.  You have the most comforting views of life.\\n\\n[_Enter_ FARQUHAR.]\\n\\nFARQUHAR.  Doctor Daubeny’s carriage!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Archdeacon!  It is only half-past ten.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  [_Rising_.]  I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton.\\nTuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny’s bad nights.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  Well, I won’t keep you from her.  [_Goes\\nwith him towards door_.]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of\\npartridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never touches\\nsolids now.  Lives entirely on jellies.  But she is wonderfully cheerful,\\nwonderfully cheerful.  She has nothing to complain of.\\n\\n[_Exit with_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Goes over to_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  There is a beautiful\\nmoon to-night.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Let us go and look at it.  To look at anything that is\\ninconstant is charming nowadays.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You have your looking-glass.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is unkind.  It merely shows me my wrinkles.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Mine is better behaved.  It never tells me the truth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then it is in love with you.\\n\\n[_Exeunt_ SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH]  May I come too?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do, my dear boy.  [_Moves towards with_ MRS. ALLONBY\\n_and_ GERALD.]\\n\\n[LADY CAROLINE _enters_, _looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite\\ndirection to that taken by_ SIR JOHN _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  What, mother!\\n\\n[_Exit_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is getting late.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother.  Do let us wait a little longer.  Lord\\nIllingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a great\\nsurprise for you.  We are starting for India at the end of this month.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid\\ngood-bye to Lord Illingworth first.  I’ll be back in five minutes.\\n[_Exit_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him—not\\nwith him!  I couldn’t bear it.  [_Walks up and down_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER.]\\n\\nHESTER.  What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Is it?\\n\\nHESTER.  Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You are so\\ndifferent from the other women here.  When you came into the Drawing-room\\nthis evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and\\npure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are things that are right to\\nsay, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.\\n\\nHESTER.  I didn’t know you had heard it.  But I knew you would agree with\\nme.  A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn’t she?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  She shouldn’t be allowed to come into the society of good men\\nand women?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  She should not.\\n\\nHESTER.  And the man should be punished in the same way?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  In the same way.  And the children, if there are\\nchildren, in the same way also?\\n\\nHESTER.  Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited\\non the children.  It is a just law.  It is God’s law.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is one of God’s terrible laws.\\n\\n[_Moves away to fireplace_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth?  Of course\\nthere is position, no doubt, and money, but position and money are not\\neverything, are they?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  They are nothing; they bring misery.\\n\\nHESTER.  Then why do you let your son go with him?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He wishes it himself.\\n\\nHESTER.  But if you asked him he would stay, would he not?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He has set his heart on going.\\n\\nHESTER.  He couldn’t refuse you anything.  He loves you too much.  Ask\\nhim to stay.  Let me send him in to you.  He is on the terrace at this\\nmoment with Lord Illingworth.  I heard them laughing together as I passed\\nthrough the Music-room.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.  It is of no\\nconsequence.\\n\\nHESTER.  No, I’ll tell him you want him.  Do—do ask him to stay.  [_Exit_\\nHESTER.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He won’t come—I know he won’t come.\\n\\n[Enter LADY CAROLINE.  _She looks round anxiously_.  _Enter_ GERALD.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the\\nterrace?\\n\\nGERALD.  No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is very curious.  It is time for him to retire.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting.  I forgot all about\\nit.  I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so happy.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  At the prospect of going away?\\n\\nGERALD.  Don’t put it like that, mother.  Of course I am sorry to leave\\nyou.  Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.  But after all, as\\nLord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a place as\\nWrockley.  You don’t mind it.  But I’m ambitions; I want something more\\nthan that.  I want to have a career.  I want to do something that will\\nmake you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth is going to help me.  He is\\ngoing to do everything for me.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, don’t go away with Lord Illingworth.  I implore\\nyou not to.  Gerald, I beg you!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, how changeable you are!  You don’t seem to know your own\\nmind for a single moment.  An hour and a half ago in the Drawing-room you\\nagreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and make objections, and\\ntry to force me to give up my one chance in life.  Yes, my one chance.\\nYou don’t suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every\\nday, do you, mother?  It is very strange that when I have had such a\\nwonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties in my\\nway should be my own mother.  Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester\\nWorsley.  Who could help loving her?  I love her more than I have ever\\ntold you, far more.  And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I\\ncould—I could ask her to—Don’t you understand now, mother, what it means\\nto me to be Lord Illingworth’s secretary?  To start like that is to find\\na career ready for one—before one—waiting for one.  If I were Lord\\nIllingworth’s secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.  As a wretched\\nbank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.  I know\\nher views on life.  She has just told them to me.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Then I have my ambition left, at any rate.  That is something—I\\nam glad I have that!  You have always tried to crush my ambition,\\nmother—haven’t you?  You have told me that the world is a wicked place,\\nthat success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that\\nsort of thing—well, I don’t believe it, mother.  I think the world must\\nbe delightful.  I think society must be exquisite.  I think success is a\\nthing worth having.  You have been wrong in all that you taught me,\\nmother, quite wrong.  Lord Illingworth is a successful man.  He is a\\nfashionable man.  He is a man who lives in the world and for it.  Well, I\\nwould give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I would sooner see you dead.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth?  Tell\\nme—tell me right out.  What is it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is a bad man.\\n\\nGERALD.  In what way bad?  I don’t understand what you mean.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will tell you.\\n\\nGERALD.  I suppose you think him bad, because he doesn’t believe the same\\nthings as you do.  Well, men are different from women, mother.  It is\\nnatural that they should have different views.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is not what Lord Illingworth believes, or what he\\ndoes not believe, that makes him bad.  It is what he is.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, is it something you know of him?  Something you actually\\nknow?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is something I know.\\n\\nGERALD.  Something you are quite sure of?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Quite sure of.\\n\\nGERALD.  How long have you known it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For twenty years.\\n\\nGERALD.  Is it fair to go back twenty years in any man’s career?  And\\nwhat have you or I to do with Lord Illingworth’s early life?  What\\nbusiness is it of ours?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What this man has been, he is now, and will be always.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did?  If he did anything\\nshameful, I will not go away with him.  Surely you know me well enough\\nfor that?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, come near to me.  Quite close to me, as you used\\nto do when you were a little boy, when you were mother’s own boy.\\n[GERALD _sits down betide his mother_.  _She runs her fingers through his\\nhair_, _and strokes his hands_.]  Gerald, there was a girl once, she was\\nvery young, she was little over eighteen at the time.  George\\nHarford—that was Lord Illingworth’s name then—George Harford met her.\\nShe knew nothing about life.  He—knew everything.  He made this girl love\\nhim.  He made her love him so much that she left her father’s house with\\nhim one morning.  She loved him so much, and he had promised to marry\\nher!  He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him.\\nShe was very young, and—and ignorant of what life really is.  But he put\\nthe marriage off from week to week, and month to month.—She trusted in\\nhim all the while.  She loved him.—Before her child was born—for she had\\na child—she implored him for the child’s sake to marry her, that the\\nchild might have a name, that her sin might not be visited on the child,\\nwho was innocent.  He refused.  After the child was born she left him,\\ntaking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and\\nall that was sweet, and good, and pure in her ruined also.  She suffered\\nterribly—she suffers now.  She will always suffer.  For her there is no\\njoy, no peace, no atonement.  She is a woman who drags a chain like a\\nguilty thing.  She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing that is a\\nleper.  The fire cannot purify her.  The waters cannot quench her\\nanguish.  Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her sleep! no poppies\\nforgetfulness!  She is lost!  She is a lost soul!—That is why I call Lord\\nIllingworth a bad man.  That is why I don’t want my boy to be with him.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of course.  But I\\ndare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth\\nwas.—After all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice feelings\\nat all, go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married, and\\nlive with him as his wife?  No nice girl would.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_After a pause_.]  Gerald, I withdraw all my\\nobjections.  You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth, when\\nand where you choose.\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I knew you wouldn’t stand in my way.  You are the\\nbest woman God ever made.  And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don’t believe\\nhe is capable of anything infamous or base.  I can’t believe it of him—I\\ncan’t.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Outside_.]  Let me go!  Let me go!  [_Enter_ HESTER _in\\nterror_, _and rushes over to_ GERALD _and flings herself in his arms_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  Oh! save me—save me from him!\\n\\nGERALD.  From whom?\\n\\nHESTER.  He has insulted me!  Horribly insulted me!  Save me!\\n\\nGERALD.  Who?  Who has dared—?\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters at back of stage_.  HESTER _breaks from_\\nGERALD’S _arms and points to him_.]\\n\\nGERALD  [_He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation_.]  Lord\\nIllingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God’s earth, a thing\\nas pure as my own mother.  You have insulted the woman I love most in the\\nworld with my own mother.  As there is a God in Heaven, I will kill you!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rushing across and catching hold of him_]  No! no!\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Thrusting her back_.]  Don’t hold me, mother.  Don’t hold\\nme—I’ll kill him!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  Let me go, I say!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Stop, Gerald, stop!  He is your own father!\\n\\n[GERALD _clutches his mother’s hands and looks into her face_.  _She\\nsinks slowly on the ground in shame_.  HESTER _steals towards the door_.\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH _frowns and bites his lip_.  _After a time_ GERALD\\n_raises his mother up_, _puts his am round her_, _and leads her from the\\nroom_.]\\n\\n                                 ACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOURTH ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n_Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s_.  _Large open French window at back_,\\n_looking on to garden_.  _Doors_ R.C. _and_ L.C.\\n\\n[GERALD ARBUTHNOT _writing at table_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ ALICE R.C. _followed by_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nALICE.  Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\n[_Exit_ L.C.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Good morning, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Rising_.]  Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs.\\nAllonby.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  We came to inquire for your dear\\nmother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?\\n\\nGERALD.  My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last\\nnight.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it\\nwas the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets\\non one’s nerves.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It’s the same thing, nowadays.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am\\nafraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.\\nArbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]  It looks\\nquite the happy English home.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.\\nOne feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,\\nGerald.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that\\na good influence is the worst in the world.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he\\nwill change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English\\nhome.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women\\nin London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but\\norchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a\\nsweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures\\nthat one can look at without blushing.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But I like blushing.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,\\nif one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell\\nme I didn’t blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very\\nparticular.  He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those\\nwho were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,\\nwas brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the\\ndevotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?\\nBy-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more\\noften now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you?\\n\\nGERALD.  I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s\\nsecretary.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Surely not, Gerald!  It would be most unwise of you.\\nWhat reason can you have?\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t think I should be suitable for the post.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.\\nBut he says I am not serious enough.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, you really mustn’t talk like that in this\\nhouse.  Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn’t know anything about the wicked society in\\nwhich we all live.  She won’t go into it.  She is far too good.  I\\nconsider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.  It gave\\nquite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in\\nthe air.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, how can you say that?  There is no resemblance\\nbetween the two things at all.  But really, Gerald, what do you mean by\\nnot being suitable?\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth’s views of life and mine are too different.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn’t have any\\nviews of life.  They are quite out of place.  You must be guided by\\nothers in this matter.  Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering\\noffer, and travelling with him you would see the world—as much of it, at\\nleast, as one should look at—under the best auspices possible, and stay\\nwith all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in\\nyour career.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t want to see the world: I’ve seen enough of it.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I hope you don’t think you have exhausted life, Mr.\\nArbuthnot.  When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t wish to leave my mother.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part.  Not\\nleave your mother!  If I were your mother I would insist on your going.\\n\\n[_Enter_ ALICE L.C.]\\n\\nALICE.  Mrs. Arbuthnot’s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad\\nheadache, and cannot see any one this morning.  [_Exit_ R.C.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps\\nyou’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better,\\nGerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, to-morrow, then.  Ah, if you had a father,\\nGerald, he wouldn’t let you waste your life here.  He would send you off\\nwith Lord Illingworth at once.  But mothers are so weak.  They give up to\\ntheir sons in everything.  We are all heart, all heart.  Come, dear, I\\nmust call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid,\\nis far from well.  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite\\nwonderful.  He is the most sympathetic of husbands.  Quite a model.\\nGood-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nGERALD.  Good-bye.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.  GERALD _sits down and reads\\nover his letter_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  What name can I sign?  I, who have no right to any name.\\n[_Signs name_, _puts letter into envelope_, _addresses it_, _and is about\\nto seal it_, _when door_ L.C. _opens and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters_.\\nGERALD _lays down sealing-wax_.  _Mother and son look at each other_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Through French window at the back_.]  Good-bye again,\\nGerald.  We are taking the short cut across your pretty garden.  Now,\\nremember my advice to you—start at once with Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  _Au revoir_, Mr. Arbuthnot.  Mind you bring me back\\nsomething nice from your travels—not an Indian shawl—on no account an\\nIndian shawl.\\n\\n[_Exeunt_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I have just written to him.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  To whom?\\n\\nGERALD.  To my father.  I have written to tell him to come here at four\\no’clock this afternoon.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He shall not come here.  He shall not cross the\\nthreshold of my house.\\n\\nGERALD.  He must come.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, if you are going away with Lord Illingworth, go\\nat once.  Go before it kills me: but don’t ask me to meet him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you don’t understand.  Nothing in the world would induce\\nme to go away with Lord Illingworth, or to leave you.  Surely you know me\\nwell enough for that.  No: I have written to him to say—\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What can you have to say to him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Can’t you guess, mother, what I have written in this letter?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, surely you can.  Think, think what must be done, now, at\\nonce, within the next few days.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is nothing to be done.\\n\\nGERALD.  I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him that he must\\nmarry you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Marry me?\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I will force him to do it.  The wrong that has been done\\nyou must be repaired.  Atonement must be made.  Justice may be slow,\\nmother, but it comes in the end.  In a few days you shall be Lord\\nIllingworth’s lawful wife.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald—\\n\\nGERALD.  I will insist upon his doing it.  I will make him do it: he will\\nnot dare to refuse.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald, it is I who refuse.  I will not marry Lord\\nIllingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  Not marry him?  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  But you don’t understand: it is for your sake I am talking, not\\nfor mine.  This marriage, this necessary marriage, this marriage which\\nfor obvious reasons must inevitably take place, will not help me, will\\nnot give me a name that will be really, rightly mine to bear.  But surely\\nit will be something for you, that you, my mother, should, however late,\\nbecome the wife of the man who is my father.  Will not that be something?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you must.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not.  You talk of atonement for a wrong done.\\nWhat atonement can be made to me?  There is no atonement possible.  I am\\ndisgraced: he is not.  That is all.  It is the usual history of a man and\\na woman as it usually happens, as it always happens.  And the ending is\\nthe ordinary ending.  The woman suffers.  The man goes free.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t know if that is the ordinary ending, mother: I hope it\\nis not.  But your life, at any rate, shall not end like that.  The man\\nshall make whatever reparation is possible.  It is not enough.  It does\\nnot wipe out the past, I know that.  But at least it makes the future\\nbetter, better for you, mother.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would\\ngive him a different answer.  Remember, he is my father.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  If he came himself, which he will not do, my answer\\nwould be the same.  Remember I am your mother.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you make it terribly difficult for me by talking like\\nthat; and I can’t understand why you won’t look at this matter from the\\nright, from the only proper standpoint.  It is to take away the\\nbitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow that lies on your\\nname, that this marriage must take place.  There is no alternative: and\\nafter the marriage you and I can go away together.  But the marriage must\\ntake place first.  It is a duty that you owe, not merely to yourself, but\\nto all other women—yes: to all the other women in the world, lest he\\nbetray more.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I owe nothing to other women.  There is not one of them\\nto help me.  There is not one woman in the world to whom I could go for\\npity, if I would take it, or for sympathy, if I could win it.  Women are\\nhard on each other.  That girl, last night, good though she is, fled from\\nthe room as though I were a tainted thing.  She was right.  I am a\\ntainted thing.  But my wrongs are my own, and I will bear them alone.  I\\nmust bear them alone.  What have women who have not sinned to do with me,\\nor I with them?  We do not understand each other.\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER _behind_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  I implore you to do what I ask you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What son has ever asked of his mother to make so hideous\\na sacrifice?  None.\\n\\nGERALD.  What mother has ever refused to marry the father of her own\\nchild?  None.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let me be the first, then.  I will not do it.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you believe in religion, and you brought me up to\\nbelieve in it also.  Well, surely your religion, the religion that you\\ntaught me when I was a boy, mother, must tell you that I am right.  You\\nknow it, you feel it.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not know it.  I do not feel it, nor will I ever\\nstand before God’s altar and ask God’s blessing on so hideous a mockery\\nas a marriage between me and George Harford.  I will not say the words\\nthe Church bids us to say.  I will not say them.  I dare not.  How could\\nI swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you\\ndishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin?  No: marriage\\nis a sacrament for those who love each other.  It is not for such as him,\\nor such as me.  Gerald, to save you from the world’s sneers and taunts I\\nhave lied to the world.  For twenty years I have lied to the world.  I\\ncould not tell the world the truth.  Who can, ever?  But not for my own\\nsake will I lie to God, and in God’s presence.  No, Gerald, no ceremony,\\nChurch-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to George Harford.  It\\nmay be that I am too bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left me\\nricher, so that in the mire of my life I found the pearl of price, or\\nwhat I thought would be so.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t understand you now.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Men don’t understand what mothers are.  I am no\\ndifferent from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I\\ndid, and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace.  And yet, to bear\\nyou I had to look on death.  To nurture you I had to wrestle with it.\\nDeath fought with me for you.  All women have to fight with death to keep\\ntheir children.  Death, being childless, wants our children from us.\\nGerald, when you were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave\\nyou food.  Night and day all that long winter I tended you.  No office is\\ntoo mean, no care too lowly for the thing we women love—and oh! how _I_\\nloved _you_.  Not Hannah, Samuel more.  And you needed love, for you were\\nweakly, and only love could have kept you alive.  Only love can keep any\\none alive.  And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain,\\nand we always fancy that when they come to man’s estate and know us\\nbetter they will repay us.  But it is not so.  The world draws them from\\nour side, and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are\\nwith us, and have amusements from which we are barred, and interests that\\nare not ours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life\\nbitter they blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste\\nits sweetness with them . . . You made many friends and went into their\\nhouses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to\\nfollow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat\\nin darkness.  What should I have done in honest households?  My past was\\never with me. . . . And you thought I didn’t care for the pleasant things\\nof life.  I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them,\\nfeeling I had no right.  You thought I was happier working amongst the\\npoor.  That was my mission, you imagined.  It was not, but where else was\\nI to go?  The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is\\npure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the\\nkiss of sin.  It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the\\nlove you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . .\\nAnd you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in\\nChurch duties.  But where else could I turn?  God’s house is the only\\nhouse where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart,\\nGerald, too much in my heart.  For, though day after day, at morn or\\nevensong, I have knelt in God’s house, I have never repented of my sin.\\nHow could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit!  Even now\\nthat you are bitter to me I cannot repent.  I do not.  You are more to me\\nthan innocence.  I would rather be your mother—oh! much rather!—than have\\nbeen always pure . . . Oh, don’t you see? don’t you understand?  It is my\\ndishonour that has made you so dear to me.  It is my disgrace that has\\nbound you so closely to me.  It is the price I paid for you—the price of\\nsoul and body—that makes me love you as I do.  Oh, don’t ask me to do\\nthis horrible thing.  Child of my shame, be still the child of my shame!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I didn’t know you loved me so much as that.  And I will\\nbe a better son to you than I have been.  And you and I must never leave\\neach other . . . but, mother . . . I can’t help it . . . you must become\\nmy father’s wife.  You must marry him.  It is your duty.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Running forwards and embracing_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  No, no; you\\nshall not.  That would be real dishonour, the first you have ever known.\\nThat would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.  Leave him and come\\nwith me.  There are other countries than England . . . Oh! other\\ncountries over sea, better, wiser, and less unjust lands.  The world is\\nvery wide and very big.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No, not for me.  For me the world is shrivelled to a\\npalm’s breadth, and where I walk there are thorns.\\n\\nHESTER.  It shall not be so.  We shall somewhere find green valleys and\\nfresh waters, and if we weep, well, we shall weep together.  Have we not\\nboth loved him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester!\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Waving him back_.]  Don’t, don’t!  You cannot love me at all,\\nunless you love her also.  You cannot honour me, unless she’s holier to\\nyou.  In her all womanhood is martyred.  Not she alone, but all of us are\\nstricken in her house.\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester, Hester, what shall I do?\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you respect the man who is your father?\\n\\nGERALD.  Respect him?  I despise him!  He is infamous.\\n\\nHESTER.  I thank you for saving me from him last night.\\n\\nGERALD.  Ah, that is nothing.  I would die to save you.  But you don’t\\ntell me what to do now!\\n\\nHESTER.  Have I not thanked you for saving _me_?\\n\\nGERALD.  But what should I do?\\n\\nHESTER.  Ask your own heart, not mine.  I never had a mother to save, or\\nshame.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is hard—he is hard.  Let me go away.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Rushes over and kneels down bedside his mother_.]  Mother,\\nforgive me: I have been to blame.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t kiss my hands: they are cold.  My heart is cold:\\nsomething has broken it.\\n\\nHESTER.  Ah, don’t say that.  Hearts live by being wounded.  Pleasure may\\nturn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but sorrow—oh, sorrow\\ncannot break it.  Besides, what sorrows have you now?  Why, at this\\nmoment you are more dear to him than ever, _dear_ though you have _been_,\\nand oh! how dear you _have_ been always.  Ah! be kind to him.\\n\\nGERALD.  You are my mother and my father all in one.  I need no second\\nparent.  It was for you I spoke, for you alone.  Oh, say something,\\nmother.  Have I but found one love to lose another?  Don’t tell me that.\\nO mother, you are cruel.  [_Gets up and flings himself sobbing on a\\nsofa_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_To_ HESTER.]  But has he found indeed another love?\\n\\nHESTER.  You know I have loved him always.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are very poor.\\n\\nHESTER.  Who, being loved, is poor?  Oh, no one.  I hate my riches.  They\\nare a burden.  Let him share it with me.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are disgraced.  We rank among the outcasts Gerald\\nis nameless.  The sins of the parents should be visited on the children.\\nIt is God’s law.\\n\\nHESTER.  I was wrong.  God’s law is only Love.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rises_, _and taking_ HESTER _by the hand_, _goes\\nslowly over to where_ GERALD _is lying on the sofa with his head buried\\nin his hands_.  _She touches him and he looks up_.]  Gerald, I cannot\\ngive you a father, but I have brought you a wife.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  So she comes first, you are worthy.  And when you are\\naway, Gerald . . . with . . . her—oh, think of me sometimes.  Don’t\\nforget me.  And when you pray, pray for me.  We should pray when we are\\nhappiest, and you will be happy, Gerald.\\n\\nHESTER.  Oh, you don’t think of leaving us?\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you won’t leave us?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I might bring shame upon you!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For a little then: and if you let me, near you always.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Come out with us to the garden.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Later on, later on.  [_Exeunt_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT _goes towards door_ L.C.   _Stops at looking-glass over\\nmantelpiece and looks into it_.  _Enter_ ALICE R.C.]\\n\\nALICE.  A gentleman to see you, ma’am.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Say I am not at home.  Show me the card.  [_Takes card\\nfrom salver and looks at it_.]  Say I will not see him.\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _sees him in the glass and\\nstarts_, _but does not turn round_.  _Exit_ ALICE.]  What can you have to\\nsay to me to-day, George Harford?  You can have nothing to say to me.\\nYou must leave this house.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you and me now,\\nso some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three.  I\\nassure you, he will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son may come in at any moment.  I saved you last\\nnight.  I may not be able to save you again.  My son feels my dishonour\\nstrongly, terribly strongly.  I beg you to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sitting down_.]  Last night was excessively\\nunfortunate.  That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I\\nwanted to kiss her.  What harm is there in a kiss?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  A kiss may ruin a human life, George\\nHarford.  _I_ know that.  _I_ know that too well.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  We won’t discuss that at present.  What is of\\nimportance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son.  I am extremely fond\\nof him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired his\\nconduct last night immensely.  He took up the cudgels for that pretty\\nprude with wonderful promptitude.  He is just what I should have liked a\\nson of mine to be.  Except that no son of mine should ever take the side\\nof the Puritans: that is always an error.  Now, what I propose is this.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  According to our ridiculous English laws, I can’t\\nlegitimise Gerald.  But I can leave him my property.  Illingworth is\\nentailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a place.  He can have\\nAshby, which is much prettier, Harborough, which has the best shooting in\\nthe north of England, and the house in St. James Square.  What more can a\\ngentleman require in this world?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing more, I am quite sure.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in\\nthese democratic days.  As George Harford I had everything I wanted.  Now\\nI have merely everything that other people want, which isn’t nearly so\\npleasant.  Well, my proposal is this.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I told you I was not interested, and I beg you to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The boy is to be with you for six months in the year,\\nand with me for the other six.  That is perfectly fair, is it not?  You\\ncan have whatever allowance you like, and live where you choose.  As for\\nyour past, no one knows anything about it except myself and Gerald.\\nThere is the Puritan, of course, the Puritan in white muslin, but she\\ndoesn’t count.  She couldn’t tell the story without explaining that she\\nobjected to being kissed, could she?  And all the women would think her a\\nfool and the men think her a bore.  And you need not be afraid that\\nGerald won’t be my heir.  I needn’t tell you I have not the slightest\\nintention of marrying.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You come too late.  My son has no need of you.  You are\\nnot necessary.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you mean, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That you are not necessary to Gerald’s career.  He does\\nnot require you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do not understand you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Look into the garden.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _rises and goes\\ntowards window_.]  You had better not let them see you: you bring\\nunpleasant memories.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _looks out and starts_.]  She\\nloves him.  They love each other.  We are safe from you, and we are going\\naway.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Where?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  We will not tell you, and if you find us we will not\\nknow you.  You seem surprised.  What welcome would you get from the girl\\nwhose lips you tried to soil, from the boy whose life you have shamed,\\nfrom the mother whose dishonour comes from you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You have grown hard, Rachel.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I was too weak once.  It is well for me that I have\\nchanged.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was very young at the time.  We men know life too\\nearly.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  And we women know life too late.  That is the difference\\nbetween men and women.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, I want my son.  My money may be of no use to\\nhim now.  I may be of no use to him, but I want my son.  Bring us\\ntogether, Rachel.  You can do it if you choose.  [_Sees letter on\\ntable_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is no room in my boy’s life for you.  He is not\\ninterested in _you_.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then why does he write to me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What do you mean?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What letter is this?  [_Takes up letter_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That—is nothing.  Give it to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is addressed to _me_.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are not to open it.  I forbid you to open it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And in Gerald’s handwriting.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not to have been sent.  It is a letter he wrote\\nto you this morning, before he saw me.  But he is sorry now he wrote it,\\nvery sorry.  You are not to open it.  Give it to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It belongs to me.  [_Opens it_, _sits down and reads\\nit slowly_. MRS. ARBUTHNOT _watches him all the time_.]  You have read\\nthis letter, I suppose, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You know what is in it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t admit for a moment that the boy is right in\\nwhat he says.  I don’t admit that it is any duty of mine to marry you.  I\\ndeny it entirely.  But to get my son back I am ready—yes, I am ready to\\nmarry you, Rachel—and to treat you always with the deference and respect\\ndue to my wife.  I will marry you as soon as you choose.  I give you my\\nword of honour.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You made that promise to me once before and broke it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I will keep it now.  And that will show you that I\\nlove my son, at least as much as you love him.  For when I marry you,\\nRachel, there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender.  High\\nambitions, too, if any ambition is high.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I decline to marry you, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you serious?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do tell me your reasons.  They would interest me\\nenormously.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have already explained them to my son.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose they were intensely sentimental, weren’t\\nthey?  You women live by your emotions and for them.  You have no\\nphilosophy of life.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are right.  We women live by our emotions and for\\nthem.  By our passions, and for them, if you will.  I have two passions,\\nLord Illingworth: my love of him, my hate of you.  You cannot kill those.\\nThey feed each other.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What sort of love is that which needs to have hate as\\nits brother?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is the sort of love I have for Gerald.  Do you think\\nthat terrible?  Well it is terrible.  All love is terrible.  All love is\\na tragedy.  I loved you once, Lord Illingworth.  Oh, what a tragedy for a\\nwoman to have loved you!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So you really refuse to marry me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Because you hate me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And does my son hate me as you do?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am glad of that, Rachel.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He merely despises you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a pity!  What a pity for him, I mean.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t be deceived, George.  Children begin by loving\\ntheir parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely if ever do they\\nforgive them.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Reads letter over again_, _very slowly_.]  May I ask\\nby what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter, this beautiful,\\npassionate letter, believe that you should not marry his father, the\\nfather of your own child?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not I who made him see it.  It was another.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What _fin-de-siècle_ person?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The Puritan, Lord Illingworth.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces_, _then rises slowly and goes over to table\\nwhere his hat and gloves are_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is standing close to the\\ntable_.  _He picks up one of the gloves, and begins pulling it on_.]\\nThere is not much then for me to do here, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is good-bye, is it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For ever, I hope, this time, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How curious!  At this moment you look exactly as you\\nlooked the night you left me twenty years ago.  You have just the same\\nexpression in your mouth.  Upon my word, Rachel, no woman ever loved me\\nas you did.  Why, you gave yourself to me like a flower, to do anything I\\nliked with.  You were the prettiest of playthings, the most fascinating\\nof small romances . . . [_Pulls out watch_.]  Quarter to two!  Must be\\nstrolling back to Hunstanton.  Don’t suppose I shall see you there again.\\nI’m sorry, I am, really.  It’s been an amusing experience to have met\\namongst people of one’s own rank, and treated quite seriously too, one’s\\nmistress, and one’s—\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _snatches up glove and strikes_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _across\\nthe face with it_.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _starts_.  _He is dazed by the\\ninsult of his punishment_.  _Then he controls himself_, _and goes to\\nwindow and looks out at his son_.  _Sighs and leaves the room_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Falls sobbing on the sofa_.]  He would have said it.\\nHe would have said it.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ HESTER _from the garden_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother.  You never came out after all.  So we have\\ncome in to fetch you.  Mother, you have not been crying?  [_Kneels down\\nbeside her_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My boy!  My boy!  My boy!  [_Running her fingers through\\nhis hair_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Coming over_.]  But you have two children now.  You’ll let me\\nbe your daughter?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Looking up_.]  Would you choose me for a mother?\\n\\nHESTER.  You of all women I have ever known.\\n\\n[_They move towards the door leading into garden with their arms round\\neach other’s waists_.  GERALD _goes to table_ L.C. _for his hat_.  _On\\nturning round he sees_ LORD ILLINGWORTH’S _glove lying on the floor_,\\n_and picks it up_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Hallo, mother, whose glove is this?  You have had a visitor.\\nWho was it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  Oh! no one.

In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3.

Newby\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"

I believe this is the first English country house you\\nhave stayed at, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?\\n\\nHESTER.  We have not many.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady\\nCaroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as\\nbig as France and England put together.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.\\n[_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of\\nmy always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more\\ncharming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively\\ndamp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a\\nlittle lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane\\nmixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high\\ndistinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of\\nParliament, Mr. Kettle—\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his\\nname before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a\\nman, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.\\n\\nHESTER.  I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like\\nyourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are\\ninvited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord\\nBrancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she\\nwas married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t\\nbelieve she ran away more than once.\\n\\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady\\nHunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to\\nhave taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is\\nright in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,\\none never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not\\nconsidered the thing.\\n\\nHESTER.  In America those are the people we respect most.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I have no doubt of it.\\n\\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so\\nsincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come\\nacross.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young\\nlady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.\\nEnglish women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They\\nshow them then.\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young\\nman and a young girl?\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a\\ncushion_.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying\\nwhat a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful\\npower of selection.  It is quite a gift.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit\\nin very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will\\ncarry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.  [_To\\nFootman_.]  The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland.\\nGet the Shetland.  [_Exit Footman for shawl_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord\\nIllingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.  It\\nmeans a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear mother will be\\ndelighted.  I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.\\nDo you think she would, Gerald?  I know how difficult it is to get her to\\ngo anywhere.\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord\\nIllingworth had made me such an offer.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman with shawl_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come\\nup and meet him.  [_To Footman_.]  Just wait, Francis.  [_Writes\\nletter_.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as\\nyou are, Mr. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show\\nmyself worthy of it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I trust so.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ HESTER.]  _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss\\nWorsley.\\n\\nHESTER.  Are you very pleased about it?\\n\\nGERALD.  Of course I am.  It means everything to me—things that were out\\nof the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.\\n\\nHESTER.  Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.  Life is a hope.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord\\nIllingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that\\nmay not be true.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I don’t think that England should be represented abroad\\nby an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you are too\\nnervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I was in hopes he\\nwould have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he said her family was too\\nlarge.  Or was it her feet?  I forget which.  I regret it very much.  She\\nwas made to be an ambassador’s wife.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering\\npeople’s names, and forgetting their faces.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?  [_To\\nFootman_.]  Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a line to\\nyour dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she\\nreally must come to dinner.\\n\\n[_Exit Footman_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.  [_To_ HESTER.]\\nWill you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  With pleasure.  [_Exit with_ GERALD.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s good\\nfortune.  He is quite a _protégé_ of mine.  And I am particularly pleased\\nthat Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord\\nwithout my suggesting anything.  Nobody likes to be asked favours.  I\\nremember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season,\\nbecause she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to me.\\nIt was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking to be in\\nany respectable household.  I don’t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to\\nget rid of her.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that explains it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, the grass is too damp for you.  You had better go\\nand put on your overshoes at once.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You must allow me to be the best judge of that, John.\\nPray do as I tell you.\\n\\n[SIR JOHN _gets up and goes off_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!\\n\\n[_Enter_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\n[_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  Well, dear, I hope you like the park.  It is said\\nto be well timbered.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Quite, quite wonderful.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country\\nfor six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take\\nthe slightest notice of me.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I assure you, dear, that the country has not that\\neffect at all.  Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from\\nhere, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.  I remember the\\noccurrence perfectly.  Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of\\njoy, or gout.  I forget which.  We had a large party staying here at the\\ntime, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I think to elope is cowardly.  It’s running away from\\ndanger.  And danger has become so rare in modern life.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can make out, the young women of the present\\nday seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing\\nwith fire.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is\\nthat one never gets even singed.  It is the people who don’t know how to\\nplay with it who get burned up.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t know how the world would get on with such a\\ntheory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Ah!  The world was made for men and not for women.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Stutfield.  We have a much better\\ntime than they have.  There are far more things forbidden to us than are\\nforbidden to them.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; that is quite, quite true.  I had not thought of\\nthat.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?\\n\\nKELVIL.  I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.  It has\\nbeen an arduous task.  The demands on the time of a public man are very\\nheavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.  And I don’t think they meet with\\nadequate recognition.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, have you got your overshoes on?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Yes, my love.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think you had better come over here, John.  It is more\\nsheltered.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  You had better sit beside me.  [SIR\\nJOHN _rises and goes across_.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been writing about this morning, Mr.\\nKelvil?\\n\\nKELVIL.  On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield.  On Purity.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That must be such a very, very interesting thing to\\nwrite about.\\n\\nKELVIL.  It is the one subject of really national importance, nowadays,\\nLady Stutfield.  I purpose addressing my constituents on the question\\nbefore Parliament meets.  I find that the poorer classes of this country\\ndisplay a marked desire for a higher ethical standard.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How quite, quite nice of them.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Are you in favour of women taking part in politics, Mr.\\nKettle?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in\\nour political life, Lady Caroline.  Women are always on the side of\\nmorality, public and private.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It is so very, very gratifying to hear you say that.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes!—the moral qualities in women—that is the\\nimportant thing.  I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord Illingworth\\ndoesn’t value the moral qualities in women as much as he should.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, very\\nwicked.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  But what world says that, Lady Stutfield?  It must be\\nthe next world.  This world and I are on excellent terms.  [_Sits down\\nbeside_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Every one _I_ know says you are very, very wicked.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about,\\nnowadays, saying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely\\nand entirely true.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless, Lady\\nStutfield.  I have given up trying to reform him.  It would take a Public\\nCompany with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that.  But\\nyou have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth, haven’t you?  Gerald\\nArbuthnot has told us of his good fortune; it is really most kind of you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Hunstanton.  Kind is a\\ndreadful word.  I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I met\\nhim, and he’ll be of considerable use to me in something I am foolish\\nenough to think of doing.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  He is an admirable young man.  And his mother is one of\\nmy dearest friends.  He has just gone for a walk with our pretty\\nAmerican.  She is very pretty, is she not?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Far too pretty.  These American girls carry off all the\\ngood matches.  Why can’t they stay in their own country?  They are always\\ntelling us it is the Paradise of women.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is, Lady Caroline.  That is why, like Eve, they are\\nso extremely anxious to get out of it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Who are Miss Worsley’s parents?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American women are wonderfully clever in concealing\\ntheir parents.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean?  Miss\\nWorsley, Caroline, is an orphan.  Her father was a very wealthy\\nmillionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained my son\\nquite hospitably, when he visited Boston.  I don’t know how he made his\\nmoney, originally.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I fancy in American dry goods.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are American dry goods?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American novels.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How very singular! . . . Well, from whatever source her\\nlarge fortune came, I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley.  She dresses\\nexceedingly well.  All Americans do dress well.  They get their clothes\\nin Paris.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans die\\nthey go to Paris.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Indeed?  And when bad Americans die, where do they go\\nto?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, they go to America.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am afraid you don’t appreciate America, Lord Illingworth.  It\\nis a very remarkable country, especially considering its youth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The youth of America is their oldest tradition.  It\\nhas been going on now for three hundred years.  To hear them talk one\\nwould imagine they were in their first childhood.  As far as civilisation\\ngoes they are in their second.\\n\\nKELVIL.  There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in American\\npolitics.  I suppose you allude to that?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I wonder.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.  They\\ncertainly are in England.  Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country.  I\\nwonder Mrs. Cardew allows him.  I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don’t\\nthink that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I think they are the only people who should.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Do you take no side then in modern politics, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil.\\nTaking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows\\nshortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore.  However, the\\nHouse of Commons really does very little harm.  You can’t make people\\ngood by Act of Parliament,—that is something.\\n\\nKELVIL.  You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown great\\nsympathy with the sufferings of the poor.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is its special vice.  That is the special vice of\\nthe age.  One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of\\nlife.  The less said about life’s sores the better, Mr. Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Still our East End is a very important problem.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  It is the problem of slavery.  And we are\\ntrying to solve it by amusing the slaves.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, a great deal may be done by means of cheap\\nentertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth.  Dear Dr. Daubeny, our\\nrector here, provides, with the assistance of his curates, really\\nadmirable recreations for the poor during the winter.  And much good may\\nbe done by means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some popular\\namusement of that kind.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not at all in favour of amusements for the poor,\\nJane.  Blankets and coals are sufficient.  There is too much love of\\npleasure amongst the upper classes as it is.  Health is what we want in\\nmodern life.  The tone is not healthy, not healthy at all.\\n\\nKELVIL.  You are quite right, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I believe I am usually right.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Horrid word ‘health.’\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Silliest word in our language, and one knows so well\\nthe popular idea of health.  The English country gentleman galloping\\nafter a fox—the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.\\n\\nKELVIL.  May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House of Lords as\\na better institution than the House of Commons?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A much better institution, of course.  We in the House\\nof Lords are never in touch with public opinion.  That makes us a\\ncivilised body.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Are you serious in putting forward such a view?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\nVulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after one has\\ngiven them an idea, whether one is serious or not.  Nothing is serious\\nexcept passion.  The intellect is not a serious thing, and never has\\nbeen.  It is an instrument on which one plays, that is all.  The only\\nserious form of intellect I know is the British intellect.  And on the\\nBritish intellect the illiterates play the drum.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are you saying, Lord Illingworth, about the drum?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about the leading\\narticles in the London newspapers.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you believe all that is written in the\\nnewspapers?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do.  Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs.\\n[_Rises with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Are you going, Mrs. Allonby?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Just as far as the conservatory.  Lord Illingworth told me\\nthis morning that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven\\ndeadly sins.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind.  I will\\ncertainly speak to the gardener.\\n\\n[_Exit_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She lets her clever tongue run away with her sometimes.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows to run\\naway with her?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope so, Caroline, I am sure.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nDear Lord Alfred, do join us.  [LORD ALFRED _sits down beside_ LADY\\nSTUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You believe good of every one, Jane.  It is a great\\nfault.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, that one\\nshould believe evil of every one?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think it is much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield.\\nUntil, of course, people are found out to be good.  But that requires a\\ngreat deal of investigation nowadays.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But there is so much unkind scandal in modern life.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner that\\nthe basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant man, but he\\nseems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and purity\\nof life which is so important in this century.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, quite, quite important, is it not?\\n\\nKELVIL.  He gives me the impression of a man who does not appreciate the\\nbeauty of our English home-life.  I would say that he was tainted with\\nforeign ideas on the subject.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of home-life,\\nis there?\\n\\nKELVIL.  It is the mainstay of our moral system in England, Lady\\nStutfield.  Without it we would become like our neighbours.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That would be so, so sad, would it not?\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards woman simply as\\na toy.  Now, I have never regarded woman as a toy.  Woman is the\\nintellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life.  Without her\\nwe should forget the true ideals.  [_Sits down beside_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I am so very, very glad to hear you say that.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You a married man, Mr. Kettle?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, dear, Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am married, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Family?\\n\\nKELVIL.  Yes.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  How many?\\n\\nKELVIL.  Eight.\\n\\n[LADY STUTFIELD _turns her attention to_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at the\\nseaside?  [SIR JOHN _shrugs his shoulders_.]\\n\\nKELVIL.  My wife is at the seaside with the children, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You will join them later on, no doubt?\\n\\nKELVIL.  If my public engagements permit me.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Your public life must be a great source of gratification\\nto Mrs. Kettle.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_To_ LORD ALFRED.]  How very, very charming those\\ngold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord Alfred.\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  They are awfully expensive.  I can only afford them when\\nI’m in debt.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be in debt.\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  One must have some occupation nowadays.  If I hadn’t my\\ndebts I shouldn’t have anything to think about.  All the chaps I know are\\nin debt.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But don’t the people to whom you owe the money give you\\na great, great deal of annoyance?\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  Oh, no, they write; I don’t.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very strange.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs.\\nArbuthnot.  She won’t dine.  I am so sorry.  But she will come in the\\nevening.  I am very pleased indeed.  She is one of the sweetest of women.\\nWrites a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm.  [_Hands letter to_ LADY\\nCAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Looking at it_.]  A little lacking in femininity, Jane.\\nFemininity is the quality I admire most in women.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Taking back letter and leaving it on table_.]  Oh!\\nshe is very feminine, Caroline, and so good too.  You should hear what\\nthe Archdeacon says of her.  He regards her as his right hand in the\\nparish.  [_Footman speaks to her_.]  In the Yellow Drawing-room.  Shall\\nwe all go in?  Lady Stutfield, shall we go in to tea?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton.  [_They rise and proceed\\nto go off_.  SIR JOHN offers to carry LADY STUTFIELD’S cloak.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!  If you would allow your nephew to look after Lady\\nStutfield’s cloak, you might help me with my workbasket.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Certainly, my love.  [_Exeunt_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Curious thing, plain women are always jealous of their\\nhusbands, beautiful women never are!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Beautiful women never have time.  They are always so\\noccupied in being jealous of other people’s husbands.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should have thought Lady Caroline would have grown tired\\nof conjugal anxiety by this time!  Sir John is her fourth!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So much marriage is certainly not becoming.  Twenty\\nyears of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of\\nmarriage make her something like a public building.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Twenty years of romance!  Is there such a thing?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Not in our day.  Women have become too brilliant.\\nNothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Or the want of it in the man.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are quite right.  In a Temple every one should be\\nserious, except the thing that is worshipped.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And that should be man?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Women kneel so gracefully; men don’t.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for\\nthe last quarter of an hour.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Is she such a mystery?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is more than a mystery—she is a mood.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Moods don’t last.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is their chief charm.\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me, Lady\\nHunstanton and Lady Caroline, and . . . every one.  I hope I shall make a\\ngood secretary.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald.  [_Talks to\\nhim_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You enjoy country life, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  Very much indeed.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Don’t find yourself longing for a London dinner-party?\\n\\nHESTER.  I dislike London dinner-parties.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I adore them.  The clever people never listen, and the\\nstupid people never talk.\\n\\nHESTER.  I think the stupid people talk a great deal.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, I never listen!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy, if I didn’t like you I wouldn’t have made\\nyou the offer.  It is because I like you so much that I want to have you\\nwith me.\\n\\n[_Exit_ HESTER _with_ GERALD.]\\n\\nCharming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He is very nice; very nice indeed.  But I can’t stand the\\nAmerican young lady.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud voice too, that\\nshe was only eighteen.  It was most annoying.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never trust a woman who tells one her real\\nage.  A woman who would tell one that, would tell one anything.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She is a Puritan besides—\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah, that is inexcusable.  I don’t mind plain women\\nbeing Puritans.  It is the only excuse they have for being plain.  But\\nshe is decidedly pretty.  I admire her immensely.  [_Looks steadfastly\\nat_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a thoroughly bad man you must be!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you call a bad man?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The sort of man who admires innocence.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And a bad woman?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are severe—on yourself.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Define us as a sex.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Sphinxes without secrets.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Does that include the Puritan women?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do you know, I don’t believe in the existence of\\nPuritan women?  I don’t think there is a woman in the world who would not\\nbe a little flattered if one made love to her.  It is that which makes\\nwomen so irresistibly adorable.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You think there is no woman in the world who would object\\nto being kissed?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Very few.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you sure?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Quite.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you think she’d do if I kissed her?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her\\nglove.  What would you do if she struck you across the face with her\\nglove?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Fall in love with her, probably.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Is that a challenge?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is an arrow shot into the air.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t you know that I always succeed in whatever I\\ntry?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I am sorry to hear it.  We women adore failures.  They\\nlean on us.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You worship successes.  You cling to them.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We are the laurels to hide their baldness.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And they need you always, except at the moment of\\ntriumph.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They are uninteresting then.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How tantalising you are!  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like\\nyou for.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only one thing?  And I have so many bad qualities.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, don’t be too conceited about them.  You may lose them\\nas you grow old.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I never intend to grow old.  The soul is born old but\\ngrows young.  That is the comedy of life.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And the body is born young and grows old.  That is life’s\\ntragedy.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Its comedy also, sometimes.  But what is the\\nmysterious reason why you will always like me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is that you have never made love to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have never done anything else.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Really?  I have not noticed it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How fortunate!  It might have been a tragedy for both\\nof us.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We should each have survived.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One can survive everything nowadays, except death, and\\nlive down anything except a good reputation.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Have you tried a good reputation?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of the many annoyances to which I have never\\nbeen subjected.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It may come.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why do you threaten me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nFRANCIS.  Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Tell her ladyship we are coming in.\\n\\nFRANCIS.  Yes, my lord.\\n\\n[_Exit_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Shall we go in to tea?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you like such simple pleasures?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I adore simple pleasures.  They are the last refuge of\\nthe complex.  But, if you wish, let us stay here.  Yes, let us stay here.\\nThe Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It ends with Revelations.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You fence divinely.  But the button has come of your\\nfoil.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I have still the mask.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It makes your eyes lovelier.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Thank you.  Come.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT’S _letter on table_, _and takes\\nit up and looks at envelope_.]  What a curious handwriting!  It reminds\\nme of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Who?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! no one.  No one in particular.  A woman of no\\nimportance.  [_Throws letter down_, _and passes up the steps of the\\nterrace with_ MRS. ALLONBY.  _They smile at each other_.]\\n\\n                                ACT DROP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSECOND ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.\\n                               _Door_ R.C.\\n\\n[_Ladies seated on sofas_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a\\nlittle!\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly\\nhappy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to\\nleave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing\\nspace after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be\\nabsolutely worn to shadows.\\n\\n[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up\\nto the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to\\nescape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their\\npower and use it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense\\nall this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper\\nplace.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re\\nnot married?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a\\nwife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going\\nabout society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry\\nwithin twelve months.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they’re in love with some\\none who, perhaps, is tied to another?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off\\nin a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to\\nmeddle with other people’s property.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other\\npeople’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the\\nonly true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we\\ndon’t belong to any one.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you really think, dear Caroline, that\\nlegislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,\\nall the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like\\nmarried men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I certainly never know one from the other.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man\\nhas home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad\\nexpression in the eyes of so many married men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly\\ntedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they\\nare not.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely\\nchanged since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor dear\\nHunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I’m tired of\\nmeeting him.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you renew him from time to time, don’t you?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh no, Lady Caroline.  I have only had one husband as yet.\\nI suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  With your views on life I wonder you married at all.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  So do I.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, I believe you are really very happy in\\nyour married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from others.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, I hope not, dear.  I knew his mother quite well.\\nShe was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland’s daughters.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Victoria Stratton?  I remember her perfectly.  A silly\\nfair-haired woman with no chin.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, Ernest has a chin.  He has a very strong chin, a\\nsquare chin.  Ernest’s chin is far too square.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But do you really think a man’s chin can be too square?\\nI think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be\\nquite, quite square.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield.  It\\nis only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I adore silent men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Ernest isn’t silent.  He talks the whole time.  But he\\nhas got no conversation.  What he talks about I don’t know.  I haven’t\\nlistened to him for years.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Have you never forgiven him then?  How sad that seems!\\nBut all life is very, very sad, is it not?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a _mauvais quart d’heure_\\nmade up of exquisite moments.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, there are moments, certainly.  But was it something\\nvery, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did?  Did he become angry with you, and\\nsay anything that was unkind or true?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh dear, no.  Ernest is invariably calm.  That is one of\\nthe reasons he always gets on my nerves.  Nothing is so aggravating as\\ncalmness.  There is something positively brutal about the good temper of\\nmost modern men.  I wonder we women stand it as well as we do.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men’s good temper shows they are not so sensitive\\nas we are, not so finely strung.  It makes a great barrier often between\\nhusband and wife, does it not?  But I would so much like to know what was\\nthe wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell\\neverybody else.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  I will make a point of repeating\\nit.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively\\non his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course\\nof his life.  I was very young at the time, so I didn’t believe him, I\\nneedn’t tell you.  Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any\\nkind till after I had been actually married four or five months.  I found\\nout then that what he had told me was perfectly true.  And that sort of\\nthing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Men always want to be a woman’s first love.  That is their\\nclumsy vanity.  We women have a more subtle instinct about things.  What\\nwe like is to be a man’s last romance.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I see what you mean.  It’s very, very beautiful.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, you don’t mean to tell me that you won’t\\nforgive your husband because he never loved any one else?  Did you ever\\nhear such a thing, Caroline?  I am quite surprised.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that\\nnothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages.  They\\napparently are getting remarkably rare.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, they’re quite out of date.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  How like the middle classes!\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes—is it not?—very, very like them.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  If what you tell us about the middle classes is true,\\nLady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit.  It is much to be\\nregretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently\\nfrivolous, under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to\\nbe.  It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we\\nall know of in society.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don’t think the frivolity of\\nthe wife has ever anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined\\nnowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else.  How\\ncan a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating\\nher as if she were a perfectly rational being?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a\\nsex that has been rational for millions and millions of years.  He can’t\\nhelp himself.  It is in his race.  The History of Woman is very\\ndifferent.  We have always been picturesque protests against the mere\\nexistence of common sense.  We saw its dangers from the first.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly most,\\nmost trying.  Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband.  I think\\nit would be so very, very helpful.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Husband?  There couldn’t be such a thing.  The\\ninstitution is wrong.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to _us_.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  He would probably be extremely realistic.\\n\\nMRS. CAROLINE.  The Ideal Man!  Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if\\nwe were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.  He should refuse\\nall our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims.  He should\\nencourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions.  He should\\nalways say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he\\nsays.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But how could he do both, dear?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should never run down other pretty women.  That would\\nshow he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much.  No; he\\nshould be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don’t attract\\nhim.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about\\nother women.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us\\nan answer all about ourselves.  He should invariably praise us for\\nwhatever qualities he knows we haven’t got.  But he should be pitiless,\\nquite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never\\ndreamed of possessing.  He should never believe that we know the use of\\nuseful things.  That would be unforgiveable.  But he should shower on us\\neverything we don’t want.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills\\nand compliments.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat\\nus with absolute respect when we are alone.  And yet he should be always\\nready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to\\nbecome miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment’s notice, and to\\noverwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be\\npositively violent at the end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever\\nat a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner.  And\\nwhen, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has\\nrefused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised\\nnever to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters,\\nhe should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long,\\nand send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine\\nquite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he\\nwas.  And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about\\neverywhere with one’s husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one\\nwas, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if\\nhis conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really\\nbadly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in\\nthe wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman’s duty to\\nforgive, and one can do it all over again from the beginning, with\\nvariations.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How clever you are, my dear!  You never mean a single\\nword you say.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  It has been quite, quite\\nentrancing.  I must try and remember it all.  There are such a number of\\ndetails that are so very, very important.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you have not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal\\nMan is to be.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  His reward?  Oh, infinite expectation.  That is quite\\nenough for him.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But men are so terribly, terribly exacting, are they\\nnot?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  That makes no matter.  One should never surrender.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Not even to the Ideal Man?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Certainly not to him.  Unless, of course, one wants to\\ngrow tired of him.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh! . . . yes.  I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\\nDo you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?  Or are\\nthere more than one?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, my dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Going over to her_.]  What has happened?  Do tell me.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_in a low voice_]  I had completely forgotten that the\\nAmerican young lady has been in the room all the time.  I am afraid some\\nof this clever talk may have shocked her a little.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that will do her so much good!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Let us hope she didn’t understand much.  I think I had\\nbetter go over and talk to her.  [_Rises and goes across to_ HESTER\\nWORSLEY.]  Well, dear Miss Worsley. [_Sitting down beside her_.]  How\\nquiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time!  I suppose\\nyou have been reading a book?  There are so many books here in the\\nlibrary.\\n\\nHESTER.  No, I have been listening to the conversation.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You mustn’t believe everything that was said, you know,\\ndear.\\n\\nHESTER.  I didn’t believe any of it\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That is quite right, dear.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Continuing_.]  I couldn’t believe that any women could really\\nhold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your\\nguests.  [_An awkward pause_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hear you have such pleasant society in America.\\nQuite like our own in places, my son wrote to me.\\n\\nHESTER.  There are cliques in America as elsewhere, Lady Hunstanton.  But\\ntrue American society consists simply of all the good women and good men\\nwe have in our country.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What a sensible system, and I dare say quite pleasant\\ntoo.  I am afraid in England we have too many artificial social barriers.\\nWe don’t see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes.\\n\\nHESTER.  In America we have no lower classes.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a very strange arrangement!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What is that dreadful girl talking about?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  She is painfully natural, is she not?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  There are a great many things you haven’t got in America,\\nI am told, Miss Worsley.  They say you have no ruins, and no curiosities.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_To_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  What nonsense!  They have their\\nmothers and their manners.\\n\\nHESTER.  The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities, Lady\\nCaroline.  They are sent over to us every summer, regularly, in the\\nsteamers, and propose to us the day after they land.  As for ruins, we\\nare trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or\\nstone.  [_Gets up to take her fan from table_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What is that, dear?  Ah, yes, an iron Exhibition, is it\\nnot, at that place that has the curious name?\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Standing by table_.]  We are trying to build up life, Lady\\nHunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests on here.\\nThis sounds strange to you all, no doubt.  How could it sound other than\\nstrange?  You rich people in England, you don’t know how you are living.\\nHow could you know?  You shut out from your society the gentle and the\\ngood.  You laugh at the simple and the pure.  Living, as you all do, on\\nothers and by them, you sneer at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread\\nto the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season.  With all your\\npomp and wealth and art you don’t know how to live—you don’t even know\\nthat.  You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the\\nbeauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of\\nlife, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing.  You have\\nlost life’s secret.  Oh, your English society seems to me shallow,\\nselfish, foolish.  It has blinded its eyes, and stopped its ears.  It\\nlies like a leper in purple.  It sits like a dead thing smeared with\\ngold.  It is all wrong, all wrong.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I don’t think one should know of these things.  It is\\nnot very, very nice, is it?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English\\nsociety so much.  You were such a success in it.  And you were so much\\nadmired by the best people.  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said\\nof you—but it was most complimentary, and you know what an authority he\\nis on beauty.\\n\\nHESTER.  Lord Henry Weston!  I remember him, Lady Hunstanton.  A man with\\na hideous smile and a hideous past.  He is asked everywhere.  No\\ndinner-party is complete without him.  What of those whose ruin is due to\\nhim?  They are outcasts.  They are nameless.  If you met them in the\\nstreet you would turn your head away.  I don’t complain of their\\npunishment.  Let all women who have sinned be punished.\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters from terrace behind in a cloak with a lace veil\\nover her head_.  _She hears the last words and starts_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady!\\n\\nHESTER.  It is right that they should be punished, but don’t let them be\\nthe only ones to suffer.  If a man and woman have sinned, let them both\\ngo forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there.  Let them\\nboth be branded.  Set a mark, if you wish, on each, but don’t punish the\\none and let the other go free.  Don’t have one law for men and another\\nfor women.  You are unjust to women in England.  And till you count what\\nis a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man, you will always be\\nunjust, and Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of cloud,\\nwill be made dim to your eyes, or be not seen at all, or if seen, not\\nregarded.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Might I, dear Miss Worsley, as you are standing up, ask\\nyou for my cotton that is just behind you?  Thank you.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Mrs. Arbuthnot!  I am so pleased you have come\\nup.  But I didn’t hear you announced.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, I came straight in from the terrace, Lady Hunstanton,\\njust as I was.  You didn’t tell me you had a party.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Not a party.  Only a few guests who are staying in the\\nhouse, and whom you must know.  Allow me.  [_Tries to help her_.  _Rings\\nbell_.]  Caroline, this is Mrs. Arbuthnot, one of my sweetest friends.\\nLady Caroline Pontefract, Lady Stutfield, Mrs. Allonby, and my young\\nAmerican friend, Miss Worsley, who has just been telling us all how\\nwicked we are.\\n\\nHESTER.  I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly, Lady Hunstanton.\\nBut there are some things in England—\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth, I\\ndare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it,\\nwhich is much more important, Lord Illingworth would tell us.  The only\\npoint where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady Caroline’s\\nbrother, about poor Lord Henry.  He is really such good company.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nTake Mrs. Arbuthnot’s things.\\n\\n[_Exit Footman with wraps_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  Lady Caroline, I had no idea it was your brother.  I am sorry\\nfor the pain I must have caused you—I—\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  My dear Miss Worsley, the only part of your little\\nspeech, if I may so term it, with which I thoroughly agreed, was the part\\nabout my brother.  Nothing that you could possibly say could be too bad\\nfor him.  I regard Henry as infamous, absolutely infamous.  But I am\\nbound to state, as you were remarking, Jane, that he is excellent\\ncompany, and he has one of the best cooks in London, and after a good\\ndinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relations.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_to_ MISS WORSLEY]  Now, do come, dear, and make friends\\nwith Mrs. Arbuthnot.  She is one of the good, sweet, simple people you\\ntold us we never admitted into society.  I am sorry to say Mrs. Arbuthnot\\ncomes very rarely to me.  But that is not my fault.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a bore it is the men staying so long after dinner!  I\\nexpect they are saying the most dreadful things about us.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really think so?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I was sure of it.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very horrid of them!  Shall we go onto the\\nterrace?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, anything to get away from the dowagers and the\\ndowdies.  [_Rises and goes with_ LADY STUTFIELD _to door_ L.C.]  We are\\nonly going to look at the stars, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You will find a great many, dear, a great many.  But\\ndon’t catch cold.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  We shall all miss Gerald so\\nmuch, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But has Lord Illingworth really offered to make Gerald\\nhis secretary?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, yes!  He has been most charming about it.  He has\\nthe highest possible opinion of your boy.  You don’t know Lord\\nIllingworth, I believe, dear.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have never met him.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You know him by name, no doubt?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am afraid I don’t.  I live so much out of the world,\\nand see so few people.  I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord\\nIllingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes.  That would be the last Earl but one.  He was\\na very curious man.  He wanted to marry beneath him.  Or wouldn’t, I\\nbelieve.  There was some scandal about it.  The present Lord Illingworth\\nis quite different.  He is very distinguished.  He does—well, he does\\nnothing, which I am afraid our pretty American visitor here thinks very\\nwrong of anybody, and I don’t know that he cares much for the subjects in\\nwhich you are so interested, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Do you think,\\nCaroline, that Lord Illingworth is interested in the Housing of the Poor?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I should fancy not at all, Jane.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  We all have our different tastes, have we not?  But\\nLord Illingworth has a very high position, and there is nothing he\\ncouldn’t get if he chose to ask for it.  Of course, he is comparatively a\\nyoung man still, and he has only come to his title within—how long\\nexactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworth succeeded?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  About four years, I think, Jane.  I know it was the same\\nyear in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I remember.  That would be about four years ago.\\nOf course, there were a great many people between the present Lord\\nIllingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  There was—who was there,\\nCaroline?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  There was poor Margaret’s baby.  You remember how anxious\\nshe was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and her husband\\ndied shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of Lord\\nAscot’s sons, who, I am told, beats her.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the family.\\nAnd there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic,\\nor a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know the\\nCourt of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that he was quite\\nsane.  And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumstead’s with straws in\\nhis hair, or something very odd about him.  I can’t recall what.  I often\\nregret, Lady Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son\\nget the title.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Cecilia?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Lord Illingworth’s mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, was one\\nof the Duchess of Jerningham’s pretty daughters, and she married Sir\\nThomas Harford, who wasn’t considered a very good match for her at the\\ntime, though he was said to be the handsomest man in London.  I knew them\\nall quite intimately, and both the sons, Arthur and George.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course, Lady\\nHunstanton?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field.  Or was\\nit fishing, Caroline?  I forget.  But George came in for everything.  I\\nalways tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has\\nhad.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once.\\nMight I see him?  Can he be sent for?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, dear.  I will send one of the servants into\\nthe dining-room to fetch him.  I don’t know what keeps the gentlemen so\\nlong.  [_Rings bell_.]  When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain\\nGeorge Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young man about town, with\\nnot a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him.  She\\nwas quite devoted to him.  Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms\\nwith his father.  Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon.  [_To Servant_.]  It\\ndoesn’t matter.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ DOCTOR DAUBENY.  SIR JOHN _goes over to_ LADY\\nSTUTFIELD, DOCTOR DAUBENY _to_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining.  I have\\nnever enjoyed myself more.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_To_ DOCTOR BAUBENY.]  You see I have got Mrs.\\nArbuthnot to come to me at last.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton.  Mrs. Daubeny\\nwill be quite jealous of you.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come with you\\nto-night.  Headache as usual, I suppose.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.  But she is\\nhappiest alone.  She is happiest alone.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_To her husband_.]  John!  [SIR JOHN _goes over to his\\nwife_.  DOCTOR BAUBENY _talks to_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT watches LORD ILLINGWORTH the whole time.  He has passed\\nacross the room without noticing her, and approaches MRS. ALLONBY, who\\nwith LADY STUTFIELD is standing by the door looking on to the terrace.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How is the most charming woman in the world?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [Taking LADY STUTFIELD by the hand.]  We are both quite\\nwell, thank you, Lord Illingworth.  But what a short time you have been\\nin the dining-room!  It seems as if we had only just left.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was bored to death.  Never opened my lips the whole\\ntime.  Absolutely longing to come in to you.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You should have.  The American girl has been giving us a\\nlecture.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Really?  All Americans lecture, I believe.  I suppose\\nit is something in their climate.  What did she lecture about?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Puritanism, of course.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am going to convert her, am I not?  How long do you\\ngive me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  A week.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A week is more than enough.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Going to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Dear mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, I don’t feel at all well.  See me home, Gerald.\\nI shouldn’t have come.\\n\\nGERALD.  I am so sorry, mother.  Certainly.  But you must know Lord\\nIllingworth first.  [_Goes across room_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Not to-night, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know my mother.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  With the greatest pleasure.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\nI’ll be back in a moment.  People’s mothers always bore me to death.  All\\nwomen become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  No man does.  That is his.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a delightful mood you are in to-night!  [_Turns\\nround and goes across with_ GERALD _to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  _When he sees\\nher_, _he starts back in wonder_.  _Then slowly his eyes turn towards_\\nGERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has offered to take me as\\nhis private secretary.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _bows coldly_.]  It is a\\nwonderful opening for me, isn’t it?  I hope he won’t be disappointed in\\nme, that is all.  You’ll thank Lord Illingworth, mother, won’t you?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth in very good, I am sure, to interest\\nhimself in you for the moment.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Putting his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  Oh,\\nGerald and I are great friends already, Mrs . . . Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There can be nothing in common between you and my son,\\nLord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, how can you say so?  Of course Lord Illingworth is\\nawfully clever and that sort of thing.  There is nothing Lord Illingworth\\ndoesn’t know.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy!\\n\\nGERALD.  He knows more about life than any one I have ever met.  I feel\\nan awful duffer when I am with you, Lord Illingworth.  Of course, I have\\nhad so few advantages.  I have not been to Eton or Oxford like other\\nchaps.  But Lord Illingworth doesn’t seem to mind that.  He has been\\nawfully good to me, mother.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth may change his mind.  He may not really\\nwant you as his secretary.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You must remember, as you said yourself, you have had so\\nfew advantages.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for a moment.  Do\\ncome over.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Will you excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot?  Now, don’t let\\nyour charming mother make any more difficulties, Gerald.  The thing is\\nquite settled, isn’t it?\\n\\nGERALD.  I hope so.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _goes across to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I thought you were never going to leave the lady in black\\nvelvet.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is excessively handsome.  [_Looks at_ MRS.\\nARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room?\\nMiss Worsley is going to play.  You’ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,\\nwon’t you?  You don’t know what a treat is in store for you.  [_To_\\nDOCTOR BAUBENY.]  I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to\\nthe rectory.  I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the\\nviolin.  Ah, I forgot.  Dear Mrs. Daubeny’s hearing is a little\\ndefective, is it not?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Her deafness is a great privation to her.  She can’t\\neven hear my sermons now.  She reads them at home.  But she has many\\nresources in herself, many resources.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She reads a good deal, I suppose?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Just the very largest print.  The eyesight is rapidly\\ngoing.  But she’s never morbid, never morbid.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  Do speak to my mother, Lord\\nIllingworth, before you go into the music-room.  She seems to think,\\nsomehow, you don’t mean what you said to me.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Aren’t you coming?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  In a few moments.  Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot\\nwould allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join\\nyou later on.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, of course.  You will have a great deal to say to\\nher, and she will have a great deal to thank you for.  It is not every\\nson who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  But I know you appreciate\\nthat, dear.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, don’t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord\\nIllingworth.  We can’t spare her.\\n\\n[_Exit following the other guests_.  _Sound of violin heard from\\nmusic-room_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So that is our son, Rachel!  Well, I am very proud of\\nhim.  He in a Harford, every inch of him.  By the way, why Arbuthnot,\\nRachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  One name is as good as another, when one has no right to\\nany name.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose so—but why Gerald?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  After a man whose heart I broke—after my father.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Well, Rachel, what in over is over.  All I have got to\\nsay now in that I am very, very much pleased with our boy.  The world\\nwill know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will be\\nsomething very near, and very dear.  It is a curious thing, Rachel; my\\nlife seemed to be quite complete.  It was not so.  It lacked something,\\nit lacked a son.  I have found my son now, I am glad I have found him.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You have no right to claim him, or the smallest part of\\nhim.  The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over\\ntwenty years.  Why not let me have him for a little now?  He is quite as\\nmuch mine as yours.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Are you talking of the child you abandoned?  Of the\\nchild who, as far as you are concerned, might have died of hunger and of\\nwant?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me.  It was\\nnot I who left you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I left you because you refused to give the child a name.\\nBefore my son was born, I implored you to marry me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I had no expectations then.  And besides, Rachel, I\\nwasn’t much older than you were.  I was only twenty-two.  I was\\ntwenty-one, I believe, when the whole thing began in your father’s\\ngarden.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old\\nenough to do right also.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities are always\\ninteresting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.  As for\\nsaying I left our child to starve, that, of course, is untrue and silly.\\nMy mother offered you six hundred a year.  But you wouldn’t take\\nanything.  You simply disappeared, and carried the child away with you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I wouldn’t have accepted a penny from her.  Your father\\nwas different.  He told you, in my presence, when we were in Paris, that\\nit was your duty to marry me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, duty is what one expects from others, it is not\\nwhat one does oneself.  Of course, I was influenced by my mother.  Every\\nman is when he is young.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am glad to hear you say so.  Gerald shall certainly\\nnot go away with you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What nonsense, Rachel!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Do you think I would allow my son—\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  _Our_ son.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son [LORD ILLINGWORTH _shrugs his shoulders_]—to go\\naway with the man who spoiled my youth, who ruined my life, who has\\ntainted every moment of my days?  You don’t realise what my past has been\\nin suffering and in shame.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, I must candidly say that I think\\nGerald’s future considerably more important than your past.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald cannot separate his future from my past.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is exactly what he should do.  That is exactly\\nwhat you should help him to do.  What a typical woman you are!  You talk\\nsentimentally, and you are thoroughly selfish the whole time.  But don’t\\nlet us have a scene.  Rachel, I want you to look at this matter from the\\ncommon-sense point of view, from the point of view of what is best for\\nour son, leaving you and me out of the question.  What is our son at\\npresent?  An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank in a third-rate\\nEnglish town.  If you imagine he is quite happy in such a position, you\\nare mistaken.  He is thoroughly discontented.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He was not discontented till he met you.  You have made\\nhim so.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Of course, I made him so.  Discontent is the first\\nstep in the progress of a man or a nation.  But I did not leave him with\\na mere longing for things he could not get.  No, I made him a charming\\noffer.  He jumped at it, I need hardly say.  Any young man would.  And\\nnow, simply because it turns out that I am the boy’s own father and he my\\nown son, you propose practically to ruin his career.  That is to say, if\\nI were a perfect stranger, you would allow Gerald to go away with me, but\\nas he is my own flesh and blood you won’t.  How utterly illogical you\\nare!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not allow him to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How can you prevent it?  What excuse can you give to\\nhim for making him decline such an offer as mine?  I won’t tell him in\\nwhat relations I stand to him, I need hardly say.  But you daren’t tell\\nhim.  You know that.  Look how you have brought him up.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have brought him up to be a good man.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  And what is the result?  You have educated\\nhim to be your judge if he ever finds you out.  And a bitter, an unjust\\njudge he will be to you.  Don’t be deceived, Rachel.  Children begin by\\nloving their parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely, if ever, do\\nthey forgive them.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  George, don’t take my son away from me.  I have had\\ntwenty years of sorrow, and I have only had one thing to love me, only\\none thing to love.  You have had a life of joy, and pleasure, and\\nsuccess.  You have been quite happy, you have never thought of us.  There\\nwas no reason, according to your views of life, why you should have\\nremembered us at all.  Your meeting us was a mere accident, a horrible\\naccident.  Forget it.  Don’t come now, and rob me of . . . of all I have\\nin the whole world.  You are so rich in other things.  Leave me the\\nlittle vineyard of my life; leave me the walled-in garden and the well of\\nwater; the ewe-lamb God sent me, in pity or in wrath, oh! leave me that.\\nGeorge, don’t take Gerald from me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, at the present moment you are not necessary to\\nGerald’s career; I am.  There is nothing more to be said on the subject.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not let him go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Here is Gerald.  He has a right to decide for himself.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother, I hope you have settled it all with Lord\\nIllingworth?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have not, Gerald.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother seems not to like your coming with me, for\\nsome reason.\\n\\nGERALD.  Why, mother?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I thought you were quite happy here with me, Gerald.  I\\ndidn’t know you were so anxious to leave me.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, how can you talk like that?  Of course I have been quite\\nhappy with you.  But a man can’t stay always with his mother.  No chap\\ndoes.  I want to make myself a position, to do something.  I thought you\\nwould have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth’s secretary.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not think you would be suitable as a private\\nsecretary to Lord Illingworth.  You have no qualifications.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs.\\nArbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I surely am\\nthe best judge.  And I can only tell you that your son has all the\\nqualifications I had hoped for.  He has more, in fact, than I had even\\nthought of.  Far more.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _remains silent_.]  Have you any\\nother reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don’t wish your son to accept this\\npost?\\n\\nGERALD.  Have you, mother?  Do answer.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.  We\\nare quite by ourselves here.  Whatever it is, I need not say I will not\\nrepeat it.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you would like to be alone with your son, I will\\nleave you.  You may have some other reason you don’t wish me to hear.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have no other reason.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing as\\nsettled.  Come, you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together.\\nAnd Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I think you have acted\\nvery, very wisely.\\n\\n[_Exit with_ GERALD.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is left alone_.  _She stands\\nimmobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face_.]\\n\\n                                 ACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHIRD ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n    _The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_.  _Door at back leading on to\\n                                terrace_.\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a\\nsofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I\\nknew she would come round in the end.\\n\\nGERALD.  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know\\nshe doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is\\nperfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I\\ncouldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value\\nwhatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is\\nnot a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.\\n\\nGERALD.  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on\\nyour side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing\\nlike youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in\\nlife’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom\\nwaiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,\\nlike most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I\\nwouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of\\nthe community.\\n\\nGERALD.  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.\\nI sometimes think she must have married beneath her.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts\\nhis hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father,\\nI suppose, Gerald?\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such\\na mother as I have had.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that\\nmost mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,\\nthat a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.\\nAfter all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such\\na hole as Wrockley, could you?\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is\\noften curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in\\nit.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Slowly_.]  I suppose there is.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good\\nwomen have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their\\ninterests are so petty, aren’t they?\\n\\nGERALD.  They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care\\nmuch about.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort\\nof thing.\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, yes, she’s always going to church.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only\\nthing worth being nowadays.  You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?\\nYou want to know life as it really is.  Not to be put of with any\\nold-fashioned theories about life.  Well, what you have to do at present\\nis simply to fit yourself for the best society.  A man who can dominate a\\nLondon dinner-table can dominate the world.  The future belongs to the\\ndandy.  It is the exquisites who are going to rule.\\n\\nGERALD.  I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always\\nbeen told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that\\nthey don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial.  By the way,\\nGerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.  Sentiment is all\\nvery well for the button-hole.  But the essential thing for a necktie is\\nstyle.  A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Laughing_.]  I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord\\nIllingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know\\nhow to talk.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to\\nevery man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you\\nwill have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.\\n\\nGERALD.  But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either\\nto feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!\\n\\nGERALD.  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of it\\nsimply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any real\\nsuccess in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule\\nsociety.  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.  You\\nmight just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at\\nonce.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You should never try to understand them.  Women are\\npictures.  Men are problems.  If you want to know what a woman really\\nmeans—which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do—look at her,\\ndon’t listen to her.\\n\\nGERALD.  But women are awfully clever, aren’t they?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always tell them so.  But, to the\\nphilosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over\\nmind—just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.\\n\\nGERALD.  How then can women have so much power as you say they have?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The history of women is the history of the worst form\\nof tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak over the\\nstrong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.\\n\\nGERALD.  But haven’t women got a refining influence?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Nothing refines but the intellect.\\n\\nGERALD.  Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren’t there?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.\\n\\nGERALD.  But there are good women in society, aren’t there?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Far too many.\\n\\nGERALD.  But do you think women shouldn’t be good?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never tell them so, they’d all become good\\nat once.  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.  Every woman is a rebel,\\nand usually in wild revolt against herself.\\n\\nGERALD.  You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Men marry because they are tired; women because they\\nare curious.  Both are disappointed.\\n\\nGERALD.  But don’t you think one can be happy when one is married?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Perfectly happy.  But the happiness of a married man,\\nmy dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.\\n\\nGERALD.  But if one is in love?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always be in love.  That is the reason one\\nshould never marry.\\n\\nGERALD.  Love is a very wonderful thing, isn’t it?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself.\\nAnd one ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a\\nromance.  But a really _grande passion_ is comparatively rare nowadays.\\nIt is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.  That is the one\\nuse of the idle classes in a country, and the only possible explanation\\nof us Harfords.\\n\\nGERALD.  Harfords, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is my family name.  You should study the Peerage,\\nGerald.  It is the one book a young man about town should know\\nthoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever\\ndone.  And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectly new life with me,\\nand I want you to know how to live.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _appears on terrace\\nbehind_.]  For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live\\nin it!\\n\\n[_Enter_ L.C. LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ DR. DAUBENY.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! here you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  Well, I\\nsuppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new\\nduties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good advice over a\\npleasant cigarette.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady\\nHunstanton, and the best of cigarettes.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I\\nsuppose I am too old now to learn.  Except from you, dear Archdeacon,\\nwhen you are in your nice pulpit.  But then I always know what you are\\ngoing to say, so I don’t feel alarmed.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah!\\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.  Come, dear.  [_Enter_ MRS.\\nARBUTHNOT.]  Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord\\nIllingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant\\nway in which everything has turned out for him.  Let us sit down.  [_They\\nsit down_.]  And how is your beautiful embroidery going on?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn’t she?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas.\\nBut the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal.  She has not touched\\nthe tambour frame for nine or ten years.  But she has many other\\namusements.  She is very much interested in her own health.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that is always a nice distraction, in it not?  Now,\\nwhat are you talking about, Lord Illingworth?  Do tell us.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the\\nworld has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in\\nwhich it has been able to bear them.  And that, consequently, whatever\\nthe world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now I am quite out of my depth.  I usually am when Lord\\nIllingworth says anything.  And the Humane Society is most careless.\\nThey never rescue me.  I am left to sink.  I have a dim idea, dear Lord\\nIllingworth, that you are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I\\nalways try to be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get.\\nAnd after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The only difference between the saint and the sinner\\nis that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that quite does for me.  I haven’t a word to say.\\nYou and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age.  We can’t follow Lord\\nIllingworth.  Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid.\\nTo have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays.  It shuts one\\nout from so much.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of\\nhis opinions.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are quite right, dear.\\n\\n[GERALD _shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother_.\\n_Enter_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Jane, have you seen John anywhere?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You needn’t be anxious about him, dear.  He is with\\nLady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room.\\nThey seem quite happy together.  You are not going, Caroline?  Pray sit\\ndown.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think I had better look after John.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It doesn’t do to pay men so much attention.  And\\nCaroline has really nothing to be anxious about.  Lady Stutfield is very\\nsympathetic.  She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about\\nanother.  A beautiful nature.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nAh! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs. Allonby too!  I suppose it was Mrs.\\nAllonby I saw him with.  Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere\\nfor you.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady\\nHunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! the Music-room, of course.  I thought it was the\\nYellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.  [_To the_\\nARCHDEACON.]  Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn’t she?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She used to be quite remarkable for her memory, but\\nsince her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early\\nchildhood.  But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great\\npleasure.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY STUTFIELD _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil been\\ntalking to you about?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Bimetallism!  Is that quite a nice subject?  However, I\\nknow people discuss everything very freely nowadays.  What did Sir John\\ntalk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  About Patagonia.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a remote topic!  But very improving, I\\nhave no doubt.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia.\\nSavages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost\\nall subjects.  They are excessively advanced.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What do they do?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Apparently everything.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it\\nnot, to find that Human Nature is permanently one.—On the whole, the\\nworld is the same world, is it not?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The world is simply divided into two classes—those who\\nbelieve the incredible, like the public—and those who do the improbable—\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Like yourself?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Yes; I am always astonishing myself.  It is the only\\nthing that makes life worth living.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful\\nqualities in my own nature.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah! don’t become quite perfect all at once.  Do it\\ngradually!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t intend to grow perfect at all.  At least, I\\nhope I shan’t.  It would be most inconvenient.  Women love us for our\\ndefects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything,\\neven our gigantic intellects.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis.  We forgive\\nadoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from us.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.  _He joins_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn’t we,\\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot?  I am sure you agree with me in that.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many\\nthings women should never forgive.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What sort of things?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The ruin of another woman’s life.\\n\\n[_Moves slowly away to back of stage_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe\\nthere are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and\\nreformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take\\nthings very, very easily.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is\\nunbecoming.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of\\nbeing terribly, terribly deceived.\\n\\nKELVIL.  The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  There is no secret of life.  Life’s aim, if it has\\none, is simply to be always looking for temptations.  There are not\\nnearly enough.  I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a\\nsingle one.  It is quite dreadful.  It makes one so nervous about the\\nfuture.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Shakes her fan at him_.]  I don’t know how it is,\\ndear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me\\nexcessively immoral.  It has been most interesting, listening to you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  All thought is immoral.  Its very essence is\\ndestruction.  If you think of anything, you kill it.  Nothing survives\\nbeing thought of.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t understand a word, Lord Illingworth.  But I\\nhave no doubt it is all quite true.  Personally, I have very little to\\nreproach myself with, on the score of thinking.  I don’t believe in women\\nthinking too much.  Women should think in moderation, as they should do\\nall things in moderation.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.  Nothing\\nsucceeds like excess.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope I shall remember that.  It sounds an admirable\\nmaxim.  But I’m beginning to forget everything.  It’s a great misfortune.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady\\nHunstanton.  No woman should have a memory.  Memory in a woman is the\\nbeginning of dowdiness.  One can always tell from a woman’s bonnet\\nwhether she has got a memory or not.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  You\\nalways find out that one’s most glaring fault is one’s most important\\nvirtue.  You have the most comforting views of life.\\n\\n[_Enter_ FARQUHAR.]\\n\\nFARQUHAR.  Doctor Daubeny’s carriage!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Archdeacon!  It is only half-past ten.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  [_Rising_.]  I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton.\\nTuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny’s bad nights.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  Well, I won’t keep you from her.  [_Goes\\nwith him towards door_.]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of\\npartridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never touches\\nsolids now.  Lives entirely on jellies.  But she is wonderfully cheerful,\\nwonderfully cheerful.  She has nothing to complain of.\\n\\n[_Exit with_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Goes over to_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  There is a beautiful\\nmoon to-night.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Let us go and look at it.  To look at anything that is\\ninconstant is charming nowadays.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You have your looking-glass.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is unkind.  It merely shows me my wrinkles.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Mine is better behaved.  It never tells me the truth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then it is in love with you.\\n\\n[_Exeunt_ SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH]  May I come too?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do, my dear boy.  [_Moves towards with_ MRS. ALLONBY\\n_and_ GERALD.]\\n\\n[LADY CAROLINE _enters_, _looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite\\ndirection to that taken by_ SIR JOHN _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  What, mother!\\n\\n[_Exit_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is getting late.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother.  Do let us wait a little longer.  Lord\\nIllingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a great\\nsurprise for you.  We are starting for India at the end of this month.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid\\ngood-bye to Lord Illingworth first.  I’ll be back in five minutes.\\n[_Exit_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him—not\\nwith him!  I couldn’t bear it.  [_Walks up and down_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER.]\\n\\nHESTER.  What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Is it?\\n\\nHESTER.  Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You are so\\ndifferent from the other women here.  When you came into the Drawing-room\\nthis evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and\\npure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are things that are right to\\nsay, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.\\n\\nHESTER.  I didn’t know you had heard it.  But I knew you would agree with\\nme.  A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn’t she?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  She shouldn’t be allowed to come into the society of good men\\nand women?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  She should not.\\n\\nHESTER.  And the man should be punished in the same way?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  In the same way.  And the children, if there are\\nchildren, in the same way also?\\n\\nHESTER.  Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited\\non the children.  It is a just law.  It is God’s law.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is one of God’s terrible laws.\\n\\n[_Moves away to fireplace_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth?  Of course\\nthere is position, no doubt, and money, but position and money are not\\neverything, are they?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  They are nothing; they bring misery.\\n\\nHESTER.  Then why do you let your son go with him?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He wishes it himself.\\n\\nHESTER.  But if you asked him he would stay, would he not?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He has set his heart on going.\\n\\nHESTER.  He couldn’t refuse you anything.  He loves you too much.  Ask\\nhim to stay.  Let me send him in to you.  He is on the terrace at this\\nmoment with Lord Illingworth.  I heard them laughing together as I passed\\nthrough the Music-room.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.  It is of no\\nconsequence.\\n\\nHESTER.  No, I’ll tell him you want him.  Do—do ask him to stay.  [_Exit_\\nHESTER.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He won’t come—I know he won’t come.\\n\\n[Enter LADY CAROLINE.  _She looks round anxiously_.  _Enter_ GERALD.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the\\nterrace?\\n\\nGERALD.  No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is very curious.  It is time for him to retire.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting.  I forgot all about\\nit.  I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so happy.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  At the prospect of going away?\\n\\nGERALD.  Don’t put it like that, mother.  Of course I am sorry to leave\\nyou.  Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.  But after all, as\\nLord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a place as\\nWrockley.  You don’t mind it.  But I’m ambitions; I want something more\\nthan that.  I want to have a career.  I want to do something that will\\nmake you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth is going to help me.  He is\\ngoing to do everything for me.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, don’t go away with Lord Illingworth.  I implore\\nyou not to.  Gerald, I beg you!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, how changeable you are!  You don’t seem to know your own\\nmind for a single moment.  An hour and a half ago in the Drawing-room you\\nagreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and make objections, and\\ntry to force me to give up my one chance in life.  Yes, my one chance.\\nYou don’t suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every\\nday, do you, mother?  It is very strange that when I have had such a\\nwonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties in my\\nway should be my own mother.  Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester\\nWorsley.  Who could help loving her?  I love her more than I have ever\\ntold you, far more.  And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I\\ncould—I could ask her to—Don’t you understand now, mother, what it means\\nto me to be Lord Illingworth’s secretary?  To start like that is to find\\na career ready for one—before one—waiting for one.  If I were Lord\\nIllingworth’s secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.  As a wretched\\nbank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.  I know\\nher views on life.  She has just told them to me.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Then I have my ambition left, at any rate.  That is something—I\\nam glad I have that!  You have always tried to crush my ambition,\\nmother—haven’t you?  You have told me that the world is a wicked place,\\nthat success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that\\nsort of thing—well, I don’t believe it, mother.  I think the world must\\nbe delightful.  I think society must be exquisite.  I think success is a\\nthing worth having.  You have been wrong in all that you taught me,\\nmother, quite wrong.  Lord Illingworth is a successful man.  He is a\\nfashionable man.  He is a man who lives in the world and for it.  Well, I\\nwould give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I would sooner see you dead.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth?  Tell\\nme—tell me right out.  What is it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is a bad man.\\n\\nGERALD.  In what way bad?  I don’t understand what you mean.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will tell you.\\n\\nGERALD.  I suppose you think him bad, because he doesn’t believe the same\\nthings as you do.  Well, men are different from women, mother.  It is\\nnatural that they should have different views.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is not what Lord Illingworth believes, or what he\\ndoes not believe, that makes him bad.  It is what he is.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, is it something you know of him?  Something you actually\\nknow?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is something I know.\\n\\nGERALD.  Something you are quite sure of?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Quite sure of.\\n\\nGERALD.  How long have you known it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For twenty years.\\n\\nGERALD.  Is it fair to go back twenty years in any man’s career?  And\\nwhat have you or I to do with Lord Illingworth’s early life?  What\\nbusiness is it of ours?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What this man has been, he is now, and will be always.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did?  If he did anything\\nshameful, I will not go away with him.  Surely you know me well enough\\nfor that?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, come near to me.  Quite close to me, as you used\\nto do when you were a little boy, when you were mother’s own boy.\\n[GERALD _sits down betide his mother_.  _She runs her fingers through his\\nhair_, _and strokes his hands_.]  Gerald, there was a girl once, she was\\nvery young, she was little over eighteen at the time.  George\\nHarford—that was Lord Illingworth’s name then—George Harford met her.\\nShe knew nothing about life.  He—knew everything.  He made this girl love\\nhim.  He made her love him so much that she left her father’s house with\\nhim one morning.  She loved him so much, and he had promised to marry\\nher!  He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him.\\nShe was very young, and—and ignorant of what life really is.  But he put\\nthe marriage off from week to week, and month to month.—She trusted in\\nhim all the while.  She loved him.—Before her child was born—for she had\\na child—she implored him for the child’s sake to marry her, that the\\nchild might have a name, that her sin might not be visited on the child,\\nwho was innocent.  He refused.  After the child was born she left him,\\ntaking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and\\nall that was sweet, and good, and pure in her ruined also.  She suffered\\nterribly—she suffers now.  She will always suffer.  For her there is no\\njoy, no peace, no atonement.  She is a woman who drags a chain like a\\nguilty thing.  She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing that is a\\nleper.  The fire cannot purify her.  The waters cannot quench her\\nanguish.  Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her sleep! no poppies\\nforgetfulness!  She is lost!  She is a lost soul!—That is why I call Lord\\nIllingworth a bad man.  That is why I don’t want my boy to be with him.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of course.  But I\\ndare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth\\nwas.—After all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice feelings\\nat all, go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married, and\\nlive with him as his wife?  No nice girl would.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_After a pause_.]  Gerald, I withdraw all my\\nobjections.  You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth, when\\nand where you choose.\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I knew you wouldn’t stand in my way.  You are the\\nbest woman God ever made.  And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don’t believe\\nhe is capable of anything infamous or base.  I can’t believe it of him—I\\ncan’t.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Outside_.]  Let me go!  Let me go!  [_Enter_ HESTER _in\\nterror_, _and rushes over to_ GERALD _and flings herself in his arms_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  Oh! save me—save me from him!\\n\\nGERALD.  From whom?\\n\\nHESTER.  He has insulted me!  Horribly insulted me!  Save me!\\n\\nGERALD.  Who?  Who has dared—?\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters at back of stage_.  HESTER _breaks from_\\nGERALD’S _arms and points to him_.]\\n\\nGERALD  [_He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation_.]  Lord\\nIllingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God’s earth, a thing\\nas pure as my own mother.  You have insulted the woman I love most in the\\nworld with my own mother.  As there is a God in Heaven, I will kill you!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rushing across and catching hold of him_]  No! no!\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Thrusting her back_.]  Don’t hold me, mother.  Don’t hold\\nme—I’ll kill him!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  Let me go, I say!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Stop, Gerald, stop!  He is your own father!\\n\\n[GERALD _clutches his mother’s hands and looks into her face_.  _She\\nsinks slowly on the ground in shame_.  HESTER _steals towards the door_.\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH _frowns and bites his lip_.  _After a time_ GERALD\\n_raises his mother up_, _puts his am round her_, _and leads her from the\\nroom_.]\\n\\n                                 ACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOURTH ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n_Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s_.  _Large open French window at back_,\\n_looking on to garden_.  _Doors_ R.C. _and_ L.C.\\n\\n[GERALD ARBUTHNOT _writing at table_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ ALICE R.C. _followed by_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nALICE.  Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\n[_Exit_ L.C.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Good morning, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Rising_.]  Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs.\\nAllonby.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  We came to inquire for your dear\\nmother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?\\n\\nGERALD.  My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last\\nnight.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it\\nwas the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets\\non one’s nerves.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It’s the same thing, nowadays.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am\\nafraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.\\nArbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]  It looks\\nquite the happy English home.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.\\nOne feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,\\nGerald.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that\\na good influence is the worst in the world.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he\\nwill change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English\\nhome.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women\\nin London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but\\norchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a\\nsweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures\\nthat one can look at without blushing.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But I like blushing.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,\\nif one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell\\nme I didn’t blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very\\nparticular.  He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those\\nwho were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,\\nwas brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the\\ndevotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?\\nBy-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more\\noften now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you?\\n\\nGERALD.  I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s\\nsecretary.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Surely not, Gerald!  It would be most unwise of you.\\nWhat reason can you have?\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t think I should be suitable for the post.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.\\nBut he says I am not serious enough.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, you really mustn’t talk like that in this\\nhouse.  Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn’t know anything about the wicked society in\\nwhich we all live.  She won’t go into it.  She is far too good.  I\\nconsider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.  It gave\\nquite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in\\nthe air.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, how can you say that?  There is no resemblance\\nbetween the two things at all.  But really, Gerald, what do you mean by\\nnot being suitable?\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth’s views of life and mine are too different.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn’t have any\\nviews of life.  They are quite out of place.  You must be guided by\\nothers in this matter.  Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering\\noffer, and travelling with him you would see the world—as much of it, at\\nleast, as one should look at—under the best auspices possible, and stay\\nwith all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in\\nyour career.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t want to see the world: I’ve seen enough of it.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I hope you don’t think you have exhausted life, Mr.\\nArbuthnot.  When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t wish to leave my mother.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part.  Not\\nleave your mother!  If I were your mother I would insist on your going.\\n\\n[_Enter_ ALICE L.C.]\\n\\nALICE.  Mrs. Arbuthnot’s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad\\nheadache, and cannot see any one this morning.  [_Exit_ R.C.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps\\nyou’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better,\\nGerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, to-morrow, then.  Ah, if you had a father,\\nGerald, he wouldn’t let you waste your life here.  He would send you off\\nwith Lord Illingworth at once.  But mothers are so weak.  They give up to\\ntheir sons in everything.  We are all heart, all heart.  Come, dear, I\\nmust call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid,\\nis far from well.  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite\\nwonderful.  He is the most sympathetic of husbands.  Quite a model.\\nGood-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nGERALD.  Good-bye.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.  GERALD _sits down and reads\\nover his letter_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  What name can I sign?  I, who have no right to any name.\\n[_Signs name_, _puts letter into envelope_, _addresses it_, _and is about\\nto seal it_, _when door_ L.C. _opens and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters_.\\nGERALD _lays down sealing-wax_.  _Mother and son look at each other_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Through French window at the back_.]  Good-bye again,\\nGerald.  We are taking the short cut across your pretty garden.  Now,\\nremember my advice to you—start at once with Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  _Au revoir_, Mr. Arbuthnot.  Mind you bring me back\\nsomething nice from your travels—not an Indian shawl—on no account an\\nIndian shawl.\\n\\n[_Exeunt_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I have just written to him.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  To whom?\\n\\nGERALD.  To my father.  I have written to tell him to come here at four\\no’clock this afternoon.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He shall not come here.  He shall not cross the\\nthreshold of my house.\\n\\nGERALD.  He must come.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, if you are going away with Lord Illingworth, go\\nat once.  Go before it kills me: but don’t ask me to meet him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you don’t understand.  Nothing in the world would induce\\nme to go away with Lord Illingworth, or to leave you.  Surely you know me\\nwell enough for that.  No: I have written to him to say—\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What can you have to say to him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Can’t you guess, mother, what I have written in this letter?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, surely you can.  Think, think what must be done, now, at\\nonce, within the next few days.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is nothing to be done.\\n\\nGERALD.  I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him that he must\\nmarry you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Marry me?\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I will force him to do it.  The wrong that has been done\\nyou must be repaired.  Atonement must be made.  Justice may be slow,\\nmother, but it comes in the end.  In a few days you shall be Lord\\nIllingworth’s lawful wife.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald—\\n\\nGERALD.  I will insist upon his doing it.  I will make him do it: he will\\nnot dare to refuse.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald, it is I who refuse.  I will not marry Lord\\nIllingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  Not marry him?  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  But you don’t understand: it is for your sake I am talking, not\\nfor mine.  This marriage, this necessary marriage, this marriage which\\nfor obvious reasons must inevitably take place, will not help me, will\\nnot give me a name that will be really, rightly mine to bear.  But surely\\nit will be something for you, that you, my mother, should, however late,\\nbecome the wife of the man who is my father.  Will not that be something?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you must.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not.  You talk of atonement for a wrong done.\\nWhat atonement can be made to me?  There is no atonement possible.  I am\\ndisgraced: he is not.  That is all.  It is the usual history of a man and\\na woman as it usually happens, as it always happens.  And the ending is\\nthe ordinary ending.  The woman suffers.  The man goes free.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t know if that is the ordinary ending, mother: I hope it\\nis not.  But your life, at any rate, shall not end like that.  The man\\nshall make whatever reparation is possible.  It is not enough.  It does\\nnot wipe out the past, I know that.  But at least it makes the future\\nbetter, better for you, mother.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would\\ngive him a different answer.  Remember, he is my father.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  If he came himself, which he will not do, my answer\\nwould be the same.  Remember I am your mother.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you make it terribly difficult for me by talking like\\nthat; and I can’t understand why you won’t look at this matter from the\\nright, from the only proper standpoint.  It is to take away the\\nbitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow that lies on your\\nname, that this marriage must take place.  There is no alternative: and\\nafter the marriage you and I can go away together.  But the marriage must\\ntake place first.  It is a duty that you owe, not merely to yourself, but\\nto all other women—yes: to all the other women in the world, lest he\\nbetray more.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I owe nothing to other women.  There is not one of them\\nto help me.  There is not one woman in the world to whom I could go for\\npity, if I would take it, or for sympathy, if I could win it.  Women are\\nhard on each other.  That girl, last night, good though she is, fled from\\nthe room as though I were a tainted thing.  She was right.  I am a\\ntainted thing.  But my wrongs are my own, and I will bear them alone.  I\\nmust bear them alone.  What have women who have not sinned to do with me,\\nor I with them?  We do not understand each other.\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER _behind_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  I implore you to do what I ask you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What son has ever asked of his mother to make so hideous\\na sacrifice?  None.\\n\\nGERALD.  What mother has ever refused to marry the father of her own\\nchild?  None.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let me be the first, then.  I will not do it.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you believe in religion, and you brought me up to\\nbelieve in it also.  Well, surely your religion, the religion that you\\ntaught me when I was a boy, mother, must tell you that I am right.  You\\nknow it, you feel it.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not know it.  I do not feel it, nor will I ever\\nstand before God’s altar and ask God’s blessing on so hideous a mockery\\nas a marriage between me and George Harford.  I will not say the words\\nthe Church bids us to say.  I will not say them.  I dare not.  How could\\nI swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you\\ndishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin?  No: marriage\\nis a sacrament for those who love each other.  It is not for such as him,\\nor such as me.  Gerald, to save you from the world’s sneers and taunts I\\nhave lied to the world.  For twenty years I have lied to the world.  I\\ncould not tell the world the truth.  Who can, ever?  But not for my own\\nsake will I lie to God, and in God’s presence.  No, Gerald, no ceremony,\\nChurch-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to George Harford.  It\\nmay be that I am too bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left me\\nricher, so that in the mire of my life I found the pearl of price, or\\nwhat I thought would be so.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t understand you now.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Men don’t understand what mothers are.  I am no\\ndifferent from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I\\ndid, and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace.  And yet, to bear\\nyou I had to look on death.  To nurture you I had to wrestle with it.\\nDeath fought with me for you.  All women have to fight with death to keep\\ntheir children.  Death, being childless, wants our children from us.\\nGerald, when you were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave\\nyou food.  Night and day all that long winter I tended you.  No office is\\ntoo mean, no care too lowly for the thing we women love—and oh! how _I_\\nloved _you_.  Not Hannah, Samuel more.  And you needed love, for you were\\nweakly, and only love could have kept you alive.  Only love can keep any\\none alive.  And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain,\\nand we always fancy that when they come to man’s estate and know us\\nbetter they will repay us.  But it is not so.  The world draws them from\\nour side, and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are\\nwith us, and have amusements from which we are barred, and interests that\\nare not ours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life\\nbitter they blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste\\nits sweetness with them . . . You made many friends and went into their\\nhouses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to\\nfollow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat\\nin darkness.  What should I have done in honest households?  My past was\\never with me. . . . And you thought I didn’t care for the pleasant things\\nof life.  I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them,\\nfeeling I had no right.  You thought I was happier working amongst the\\npoor.  That was my mission, you imagined.  It was not, but where else was\\nI to go?  The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is\\npure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the\\nkiss of sin.  It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the\\nlove you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . .\\nAnd you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in\\nChurch duties.  But where else could I turn?  God’s house is the only\\nhouse where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart,\\nGerald, too much in my heart.  For, though day after day, at morn or\\nevensong, I have knelt in God’s house, I have never repented of my sin.\\nHow could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit!  Even now\\nthat you are bitter to me I cannot repent.  I do not.  You are more to me\\nthan innocence.  I would rather be your mother—oh! much rather!—than have\\nbeen always pure . . . Oh, don’t you see? don’t you understand?  It is my\\ndishonour that has made you so dear to me.  It is my disgrace that has\\nbound you so closely to me.  It is the price I paid for you—the price of\\nsoul and body—that makes me love you as I do.  Oh, don’t ask me to do\\nthis horrible thing.  Child of my shame, be still the child of my shame!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I didn’t know you loved me so much as that.  And I will\\nbe a better son to you than I have been.  And you and I must never leave\\neach other . . . but, mother . . . I can’t help it . . . you must become\\nmy father’s wife.  You must marry him.  It is your duty.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Running forwards and embracing_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  No, no; you\\nshall not.  That would be real dishonour, the first you have ever known.\\nThat would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.  Leave him and come\\nwith me.  There are other countries than England . . . Oh! other\\ncountries over sea, better, wiser, and less unjust lands.  The world is\\nvery wide and very big.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No, not for me.  For me the world is shrivelled to a\\npalm’s breadth, and where I walk there are thorns.\\n\\nHESTER.  It shall not be so.  We shall somewhere find green valleys and\\nfresh waters, and if we weep, well, we shall weep together.  Have we not\\nboth loved him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester!\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Waving him back_.]  Don’t, don’t!  You cannot love me at all,\\nunless you love her also.  You cannot honour me, unless she’s holier to\\nyou.  In her all womanhood is martyred.  Not she alone, but all of us are\\nstricken in her house.\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester, Hester, what shall I do?\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you respect the man who is your father?\\n\\nGERALD.  Respect him?  I despise him!  He is infamous.\\n\\nHESTER.  I thank you for saving me from him last night.\\n\\nGERALD.  Ah, that is nothing.  I would die to save you.  But you don’t\\ntell me what to do now!\\n\\nHESTER.  Have I not thanked you for saving _me_?\\n\\nGERALD.  But what should I do?\\n\\nHESTER.  Ask your own heart, not mine.  I never had a mother to save, or\\nshame.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is hard—he is hard.  Let me go away.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Rushes over and kneels down bedside his mother_.]  Mother,\\nforgive me: I have been to blame.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t kiss my hands: they are cold.  My heart is cold:\\nsomething has broken it.\\n\\nHESTER.  Ah, don’t say that.  Hearts live by being wounded.  Pleasure may\\nturn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but sorrow—oh, sorrow\\ncannot break it.  Besides, what sorrows have you now?  Why, at this\\nmoment you are more dear to him than ever, _dear_ though you have _been_,\\nand oh! how dear you _have_ been always.  Ah! be kind to him.\\n\\nGERALD.  You are my mother and my father all in one.  I need no second\\nparent.  It was for you I spoke, for you alone.  Oh, say something,\\nmother.  Have I but found one love to lose another?  Don’t tell me that.\\nO mother, you are cruel.  [_Gets up and flings himself sobbing on a\\nsofa_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_To_ HESTER.]  But has he found indeed another love?\\n\\nHESTER.  You know I have loved him always.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are very poor.\\n\\nHESTER.  Who, being loved, is poor?  Oh, no one.  I hate my riches.  They\\nare a burden.  Let him share it with me.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are disgraced.  We rank among the outcasts Gerald\\nis nameless.  The sins of the parents should be visited on the children.\\nIt is God’s law.\\n\\nHESTER.  I was wrong.  God’s law is only Love.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rises_, _and taking_ HESTER _by the hand_, _goes\\nslowly over to where_ GERALD _is lying on the sofa with his head buried\\nin his hands_.  _She touches him and he looks up_.]  Gerald, I cannot\\ngive you a father, but I have brought you a wife.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  So she comes first, you are worthy.  And when you are\\naway, Gerald . . . with . . . her—oh, think of me sometimes.  Don’t\\nforget me.  And when you pray, pray for me.  We should pray when we are\\nhappiest, and you will be happy, Gerald.\\n\\nHESTER.  Oh, you don’t think of leaving us?\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you won’t leave us?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I might bring shame upon you!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For a little then: and if you let me, near you always.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Come out with us to the garden.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Later on, later on.  [_Exeunt_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT _goes towards door_ L.C.   _Stops at looking-glass over\\nmantelpiece and looks into it_.  _Enter_ ALICE R.C.]\\n\\nALICE.  A gentleman to see you, ma’am.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Say I am not at home.  Show me the card.  [_Takes card\\nfrom salver and looks at it_.]  Say I will not see him.\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _sees him in the glass and\\nstarts_, _but does not turn round_.  _Exit_ ALICE.]  What can you have to\\nsay to me to-day, George Harford?  You can have nothing to say to me.\\nYou must leave this house.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you and me now,\\nso some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three.  I\\nassure you, he will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son may come in at any moment.  I saved you last\\nnight.  I may not be able to save you again.  My son feels my dishonour\\nstrongly, terribly strongly.  I beg you to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sitting down_.]  Last night was excessively\\nunfortunate.  That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I\\nwanted to kiss her.  What harm is there in a kiss?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  A kiss may ruin a human life, George\\nHarford.  _I_ know that.  _I_ know that too well.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  We won’t discuss that at present.  What is of\\nimportance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son.  I am extremely fond\\nof him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired his\\nconduct last night immensely.  He took up the cudgels for that pretty\\nprude with wonderful promptitude.  He is just what I should have liked a\\nson of mine to be.  Except that no son of mine should ever take the side\\nof the Puritans: that is always an error.  Now, what I propose is this.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  According to our ridiculous English laws, I can’t\\nlegitimise Gerald.  But I can leave him my property.  Illingworth is\\nentailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a place.  He can have\\nAshby, which is much prettier, Harborough, which has the best shooting in\\nthe north of England, and the house in St. James Square.  What more can a\\ngentleman require in this world?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing more, I am quite sure.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in\\nthese democratic days.  As George Harford I had everything I wanted.  Now\\nI have merely everything that other people want, which isn’t nearly so\\npleasant.  Well, my proposal is this.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I told you I was not interested, and I beg you to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The boy is to be with you for six months in the year,\\nand with me for the other six.  That is perfectly fair, is it not?  You\\ncan have whatever allowance you like, and live where you choose.  As for\\nyour past, no one knows anything about it except myself and Gerald.\\nThere is the Puritan, of course, the Puritan in white muslin, but she\\ndoesn’t count.  She couldn’t tell the story without explaining that she\\nobjected to being kissed, could she?  And all the women would think her a\\nfool and the men think her a bore.  And you need not be afraid that\\nGerald won’t be my heir.  I needn’t tell you I have not the slightest\\nintention of marrying.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You come too late.  My son has no need of you.  You are\\nnot necessary.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you mean, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That you are not necessary to Gerald’s career.  He does\\nnot require you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do not understand you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Look into the garden.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _rises and goes\\ntowards window_.]  You had better not let them see you: you bring\\nunpleasant memories.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _looks out and starts_.]  She\\nloves him.  They love each other.  We are safe from you, and we are going\\naway.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Where?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  We will not tell you, and if you find us we will not\\nknow you.  You seem surprised.  What welcome would you get from the girl\\nwhose lips you tried to soil, from the boy whose life you have shamed,\\nfrom the mother whose dishonour comes from you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You have grown hard, Rachel.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I was too weak once.  It is well for me that I have\\nchanged.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was very young at the time.  We men know life too\\nearly.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  And we women know life too late.  That is the difference\\nbetween men and women.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, I want my son.  My money may be of no use to\\nhim now.  I may be of no use to him, but I want my son.  Bring us\\ntogether, Rachel.  You can do it if you choose.  [_Sees letter on\\ntable_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is no room in my boy’s life for you.  He is not\\ninterested in _you_.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then why does he write to me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What do you mean?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What letter is this?  [_Takes up letter_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That—is nothing.  Give it to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is addressed to _me_.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are not to open it.  I forbid you to open it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And in Gerald’s handwriting.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not to have been sent.  It is a letter he wrote\\nto you this morning, before he saw me.  But he is sorry now he wrote it,\\nvery sorry.  You are not to open it.  Give it to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It belongs to me.  [_Opens it_, _sits down and reads\\nit slowly_. MRS. ARBUTHNOT _watches him all the time_.]  You have read\\nthis letter, I suppose, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You know what is in it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t admit for a moment that the boy is right in\\nwhat he says.  I don’t admit that it is any duty of mine to marry you.  I\\ndeny it entirely.  But to get my son back I am ready—yes, I am ready to\\nmarry you, Rachel—and to treat you always with the deference and respect\\ndue to my wife.  I will marry you as soon as you choose.  I give you my\\nword of honour.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You made that promise to me once before and broke it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I will keep it now.  And that will show you that I\\nlove my son, at least as much as you love him.  For when I marry you,\\nRachel, there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender.  High\\nambitions, too, if any ambition is high.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I decline to marry you, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you serious?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do tell me your reasons.  They would interest me\\nenormously.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have already explained them to my son.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose they were intensely sentimental, weren’t\\nthey?  You women live by your emotions and for them.  You have no\\nphilosophy of life.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are right.  We women live by our emotions and for\\nthem.  By our passions, and for them, if you will.  I have two passions,\\nLord Illingworth: my love of him, my hate of you.  You cannot kill those.\\nThey feed each other.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What sort of love is that which needs to have hate as\\nits brother?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is the sort of love I have for Gerald.  Do you think\\nthat terrible?  Well it is terrible.  All love is terrible.  All love is\\na tragedy.  I loved you once, Lord Illingworth.  Oh, what a tragedy for a\\nwoman to have loved you!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So you really refuse to marry me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Because you hate me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And does my son hate me as you do?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am glad of that, Rachel.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He merely despises you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a pity!  What a pity for him, I mean.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t be deceived, George.  Children begin by loving\\ntheir parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely if ever do they\\nforgive them.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Reads letter over again_, _very slowly_.]  May I ask\\nby what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter, this beautiful,\\npassionate letter, believe that you should not marry his father, the\\nfather of your own child?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not I who made him see it.  It was another.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What _fin-de-siècle_ person?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The Puritan, Lord Illingworth.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces_, _then rises slowly and goes over to table\\nwhere his hat and gloves are_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is standing close to the\\ntable_.  _He picks up one of the gloves, and begins pulling it on_.]\\nThere is not much then for me to do here, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is good-bye, is it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For ever, I hope, this time, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How curious!  At this moment you look exactly as you\\nlooked the night you left me twenty years ago.  You have just the same\\nexpression in your mouth.  Upon my word, Rachel, no woman ever loved me\\nas you did.  Why, you gave yourself to me like a flower, to do anything I\\nliked with.  You were the prettiest of playthings, the most fascinating\\nof small romances . . . [_Pulls out watch_.]  Quarter to two!  Must be\\nstrolling back to Hunstanton.  Don’t suppose I shall see you there again.\\nI’m sorry, I am, really.  It’s been an amusing experience to have met\\namongst people of one’s own rank, and treated quite seriously too, one’s\\nmistress, and one’s—\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _snatches up glove and strikes_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _across\\nthe face with it_.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _starts_.  _He is dazed by the\\ninsult of his punishment_.  _Then he controls himself_, _and goes to\\nwindow and looks out at his son_.  _Sighs and leaves the room_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Falls sobbing on the sofa_.]  He would have said it.\\nHe would have said it.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ HESTER _from the garden_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother.  You never came out after all.  So we have\\ncome in to fetch you.  Mother, you have not been crying?  [_Kneels down\\nbeside her_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My boy!  My boy!  My boy!  [_Running her fingers through\\nhis hair_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Coming over_.]  But you have two children now.  You’ll let me\\nbe your daughter?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Looking up_.]  Would you choose me for a mother?\\n\\nHESTER.  You of all women I have ever known.\\n\\n[_They move towards the door leading into garden with their arms round\\neach other’s waists_.  GERALD _goes to table_ L.C. _for his hat_.  _On\\nturning round he sees_ LORD ILLINGWORTH’S _glove lying on the floor_,\\n_and picks it up_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Hallo, mother, whose glove is this?  You have had a visitor.\\nWho was it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  Oh! no one.

In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3.

Newby\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"

I believe this is the first English country house you\\nhave stayed at, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?\\n\\nHESTER.  We have not many.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady\\nCaroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as\\nbig as France and England put together.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.\\n[_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of\\nmy always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more\\ncharming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively\\ndamp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a\\nlittle lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane\\nmixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high\\ndistinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of\\nParliament, Mr. Kettle—\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his\\nname before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a\\nman, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.\\n\\nHESTER.  I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like\\nyourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are\\ninvited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord\\nBrancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she\\nwas married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t\\nbelieve she ran away more than once.\\n\\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady\\nHunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to\\nhave taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is\\nright in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,\\none never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not\\nconsidered the thing.\\n\\nHESTER.  In America those are the people we respect most.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I have no doubt of it.\\n\\nHESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so\\nsincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come\\nacross.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young\\nlady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.\\nEnglish women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They\\nshow them then.\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young\\nman and a young girl?\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a\\ncushion_.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying\\nwhat a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful\\npower of selection.  It is quite a gift.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit\\nin very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will\\ncarry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.  [_To\\nFootman_.]  The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland.\\nGet the Shetland.  [_Exit Footman for shawl_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord\\nIllingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.  It\\nmeans a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear mother will be\\ndelighted.  I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.\\nDo you think she would, Gerald?  I know how difficult it is to get her to\\ngo anywhere.\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord\\nIllingworth had made me such an offer.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman with shawl_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come\\nup and meet him.  [_To Footman_.]  Just wait, Francis.  [_Writes\\nletter_.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as\\nyou are, Mr. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show\\nmyself worthy of it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I trust so.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ HESTER.]  _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss\\nWorsley.\\n\\nHESTER.  Are you very pleased about it?\\n\\nGERALD.  Of course I am.  It means everything to me—things that were out\\nof the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.\\n\\nHESTER.  Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.  Life is a hope.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord\\nIllingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that\\nmay not be true.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I don’t think that England should be represented abroad\\nby an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you are too\\nnervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I was in hopes he\\nwould have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he said her family was too\\nlarge.  Or was it her feet?  I forget which.  I regret it very much.  She\\nwas made to be an ambassador’s wife.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering\\npeople’s names, and forgetting their faces.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?  [_To\\nFootman_.]  Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a line to\\nyour dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she\\nreally must come to dinner.\\n\\n[_Exit Footman_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.  [_To_ HESTER.]\\nWill you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  With pleasure.  [_Exit with_ GERALD.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s good\\nfortune.  He is quite a _protégé_ of mine.  And I am particularly pleased\\nthat Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord\\nwithout my suggesting anything.  Nobody likes to be asked favours.  I\\nremember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season,\\nbecause she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to me.\\nIt was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking to be in\\nany respectable household.  I don’t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to\\nget rid of her.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that explains it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, the grass is too damp for you.  You had better go\\nand put on your overshoes at once.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You must allow me to be the best judge of that, John.\\nPray do as I tell you.\\n\\n[SIR JOHN _gets up and goes off_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!\\n\\n[_Enter_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\n[_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  Well, dear, I hope you like the park.  It is said\\nto be well timbered.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Quite, quite wonderful.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country\\nfor six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take\\nthe slightest notice of me.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I assure you, dear, that the country has not that\\neffect at all.  Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from\\nhere, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.  I remember the\\noccurrence perfectly.  Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of\\njoy, or gout.  I forget which.  We had a large party staying here at the\\ntime, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I think to elope is cowardly.  It’s running away from\\ndanger.  And danger has become so rare in modern life.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can make out, the young women of the present\\nday seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing\\nwith fire.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is\\nthat one never gets even singed.  It is the people who don’t know how to\\nplay with it who get burned up.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t know how the world would get on with such a\\ntheory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Ah!  The world was made for men and not for women.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Stutfield.  We have a much better\\ntime than they have.  There are far more things forbidden to us than are\\nforbidden to them.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; that is quite, quite true.  I had not thought of\\nthat.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?\\n\\nKELVIL.  I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.  It has\\nbeen an arduous task.  The demands on the time of a public man are very\\nheavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.  And I don’t think they meet with\\nadequate recognition.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John, have you got your overshoes on?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Yes, my love.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think you had better come over here, John.  It is more\\nsheltered.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  You had better sit beside me.  [SIR\\nJOHN _rises and goes across_.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been writing about this morning, Mr.\\nKelvil?\\n\\nKELVIL.  On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield.  On Purity.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That must be such a very, very interesting thing to\\nwrite about.\\n\\nKELVIL.  It is the one subject of really national importance, nowadays,\\nLady Stutfield.  I purpose addressing my constituents on the question\\nbefore Parliament meets.  I find that the poorer classes of this country\\ndisplay a marked desire for a higher ethical standard.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How quite, quite nice of them.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Are you in favour of women taking part in politics, Mr.\\nKettle?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in\\nour political life, Lady Caroline.  Women are always on the side of\\nmorality, public and private.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It is so very, very gratifying to hear you say that.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes!—the moral qualities in women—that is the\\nimportant thing.  I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord Illingworth\\ndoesn’t value the moral qualities in women as much as he should.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, very\\nwicked.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  But what world says that, Lady Stutfield?  It must be\\nthe next world.  This world and I are on excellent terms.  [_Sits down\\nbeside_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Every one _I_ know says you are very, very wicked.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about,\\nnowadays, saying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely\\nand entirely true.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless, Lady\\nStutfield.  I have given up trying to reform him.  It would take a Public\\nCompany with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that.  But\\nyou have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth, haven’t you?  Gerald\\nArbuthnot has told us of his good fortune; it is really most kind of you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Hunstanton.  Kind is a\\ndreadful word.  I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I met\\nhim, and he’ll be of considerable use to me in something I am foolish\\nenough to think of doing.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  He is an admirable young man.  And his mother is one of\\nmy dearest friends.  He has just gone for a walk with our pretty\\nAmerican.  She is very pretty, is she not?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Far too pretty.  These American girls carry off all the\\ngood matches.  Why can’t they stay in their own country?  They are always\\ntelling us it is the Paradise of women.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is, Lady Caroline.  That is why, like Eve, they are\\nso extremely anxious to get out of it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Who are Miss Worsley’s parents?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American women are wonderfully clever in concealing\\ntheir parents.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean?  Miss\\nWorsley, Caroline, is an orphan.  Her father was a very wealthy\\nmillionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained my son\\nquite hospitably, when he visited Boston.  I don’t know how he made his\\nmoney, originally.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I fancy in American dry goods.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are American dry goods?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  American novels.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How very singular! . . . Well, from whatever source her\\nlarge fortune came, I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley.  She dresses\\nexceedingly well.  All Americans do dress well.  They get their clothes\\nin Paris.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans die\\nthey go to Paris.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Indeed?  And when bad Americans die, where do they go\\nto?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, they go to America.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am afraid you don’t appreciate America, Lord Illingworth.  It\\nis a very remarkable country, especially considering its youth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The youth of America is their oldest tradition.  It\\nhas been going on now for three hundred years.  To hear them talk one\\nwould imagine they were in their first childhood.  As far as civilisation\\ngoes they are in their second.\\n\\nKELVIL.  There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in American\\npolitics.  I suppose you allude to that?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I wonder.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.  They\\ncertainly are in England.  Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country.  I\\nwonder Mrs. Cardew allows him.  I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don’t\\nthink that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I think they are the only people who should.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Do you take no side then in modern politics, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil.\\nTaking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows\\nshortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore.  However, the\\nHouse of Commons really does very little harm.  You can’t make people\\ngood by Act of Parliament,—that is something.\\n\\nKELVIL.  You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown great\\nsympathy with the sufferings of the poor.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is its special vice.  That is the special vice of\\nthe age.  One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of\\nlife.  The less said about life’s sores the better, Mr. Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Still our East End is a very important problem.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  It is the problem of slavery.  And we are\\ntrying to solve it by amusing the slaves.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, a great deal may be done by means of cheap\\nentertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth.  Dear Dr. Daubeny, our\\nrector here, provides, with the assistance of his curates, really\\nadmirable recreations for the poor during the winter.  And much good may\\nbe done by means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some popular\\namusement of that kind.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I am not at all in favour of amusements for the poor,\\nJane.  Blankets and coals are sufficient.  There is too much love of\\npleasure amongst the upper classes as it is.  Health is what we want in\\nmodern life.  The tone is not healthy, not healthy at all.\\n\\nKELVIL.  You are quite right, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I believe I am usually right.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Horrid word ‘health.’\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Silliest word in our language, and one knows so well\\nthe popular idea of health.  The English country gentleman galloping\\nafter a fox—the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.\\n\\nKELVIL.  May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House of Lords as\\na better institution than the House of Commons?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A much better institution, of course.  We in the House\\nof Lords are never in touch with public opinion.  That makes us a\\ncivilised body.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Are you serious in putting forward such a view?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\nVulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after one has\\ngiven them an idea, whether one is serious or not.  Nothing is serious\\nexcept passion.  The intellect is not a serious thing, and never has\\nbeen.  It is an instrument on which one plays, that is all.  The only\\nserious form of intellect I know is the British intellect.  And on the\\nBritish intellect the illiterates play the drum.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What are you saying, Lord Illingworth, about the drum?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about the leading\\narticles in the London newspapers.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you believe all that is written in the\\nnewspapers?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do.  Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs.\\n[_Rises with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Are you going, Mrs. Allonby?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Just as far as the conservatory.  Lord Illingworth told me\\nthis morning that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven\\ndeadly sins.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind.  I will\\ncertainly speak to the gardener.\\n\\n[_Exit_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She lets her clever tongue run away with her sometimes.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows to run\\naway with her?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope so, Caroline, I am sure.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nDear Lord Alfred, do join us.  [LORD ALFRED _sits down beside_ LADY\\nSTUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You believe good of every one, Jane.  It is a great\\nfault.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, that one\\nshould believe evil of every one?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think it is much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield.\\nUntil, of course, people are found out to be good.  But that requires a\\ngreat deal of investigation nowadays.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But there is so much unkind scandal in modern life.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner that\\nthe basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty.\\n\\nKELVIL.  Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant man, but he\\nseems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and purity\\nof life which is so important in this century.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, quite, quite important, is it not?\\n\\nKELVIL.  He gives me the impression of a man who does not appreciate the\\nbeauty of our English home-life.  I would say that he was tainted with\\nforeign ideas on the subject.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of home-life,\\nis there?\\n\\nKELVIL.  It is the mainstay of our moral system in England, Lady\\nStutfield.  Without it we would become like our neighbours.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  That would be so, so sad, would it not?\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards woman simply as\\na toy.  Now, I have never regarded woman as a toy.  Woman is the\\nintellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life.  Without her\\nwe should forget the true ideals.  [_Sits down beside_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I am so very, very glad to hear you say that.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You a married man, Mr. Kettle?\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, dear, Kelvil.\\n\\nKELVIL.  I am married, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Family?\\n\\nKELVIL.  Yes.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  How many?\\n\\nKELVIL.  Eight.\\n\\n[LADY STUTFIELD _turns her attention to_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at the\\nseaside?  [SIR JOHN _shrugs his shoulders_.]\\n\\nKELVIL.  My wife is at the seaside with the children, Lady Caroline.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  You will join them later on, no doubt?\\n\\nKELVIL.  If my public engagements permit me.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Your public life must be a great source of gratification\\nto Mrs. Kettle.\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_To_ LORD ALFRED.]  How very, very charming those\\ngold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord Alfred.\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  They are awfully expensive.  I can only afford them when\\nI’m in debt.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be in debt.\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  One must have some occupation nowadays.  If I hadn’t my\\ndebts I shouldn’t have anything to think about.  All the chaps I know are\\nin debt.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But don’t the people to whom you owe the money give you\\na great, great deal of annoyance?\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nLORD ALFRED.  Oh, no, they write; I don’t.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very strange.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs.\\nArbuthnot.  She won’t dine.  I am so sorry.  But she will come in the\\nevening.  I am very pleased indeed.  She is one of the sweetest of women.\\nWrites a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm.  [_Hands letter to_ LADY\\nCAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Looking at it_.]  A little lacking in femininity, Jane.\\nFemininity is the quality I admire most in women.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Taking back letter and leaving it on table_.]  Oh!\\nshe is very feminine, Caroline, and so good too.  You should hear what\\nthe Archdeacon says of her.  He regards her as his right hand in the\\nparish.  [_Footman speaks to her_.]  In the Yellow Drawing-room.  Shall\\nwe all go in?  Lady Stutfield, shall we go in to tea?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton.  [_They rise and proceed\\nto go off_.  SIR JOHN offers to carry LADY STUTFIELD’S cloak.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!  If you would allow your nephew to look after Lady\\nStutfield’s cloak, you might help me with my workbasket.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nSIR JOHN.  Certainly, my love.  [_Exeunt_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Curious thing, plain women are always jealous of their\\nhusbands, beautiful women never are!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Beautiful women never have time.  They are always so\\noccupied in being jealous of other people’s husbands.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should have thought Lady Caroline would have grown tired\\nof conjugal anxiety by this time!  Sir John is her fourth!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So much marriage is certainly not becoming.  Twenty\\nyears of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of\\nmarriage make her something like a public building.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Twenty years of romance!  Is there such a thing?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Not in our day.  Women have become too brilliant.\\nNothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Or the want of it in the man.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are quite right.  In a Temple every one should be\\nserious, except the thing that is worshipped.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And that should be man?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Women kneel so gracefully; men don’t.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for\\nthe last quarter of an hour.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Is she such a mystery?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is more than a mystery—she is a mood.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Moods don’t last.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is their chief charm.\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me, Lady\\nHunstanton and Lady Caroline, and . . . every one.  I hope I shall make a\\ngood secretary.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald.  [_Talks to\\nhim_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You enjoy country life, Miss Worsley?\\n\\nHESTER.  Very much indeed.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Don’t find yourself longing for a London dinner-party?\\n\\nHESTER.  I dislike London dinner-parties.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I adore them.  The clever people never listen, and the\\nstupid people never talk.\\n\\nHESTER.  I think the stupid people talk a great deal.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, I never listen!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy, if I didn’t like you I wouldn’t have made\\nyou the offer.  It is because I like you so much that I want to have you\\nwith me.\\n\\n[_Exit_ HESTER _with_ GERALD.]\\n\\nCharming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He is very nice; very nice indeed.  But I can’t stand the\\nAmerican young lady.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud voice too, that\\nshe was only eighteen.  It was most annoying.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never trust a woman who tells one her real\\nage.  A woman who would tell one that, would tell one anything.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  She is a Puritan besides—\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah, that is inexcusable.  I don’t mind plain women\\nbeing Puritans.  It is the only excuse they have for being plain.  But\\nshe is decidedly pretty.  I admire her immensely.  [_Looks steadfastly\\nat_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a thoroughly bad man you must be!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you call a bad man?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The sort of man who admires innocence.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And a bad woman?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are severe—on yourself.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Define us as a sex.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Sphinxes without secrets.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Does that include the Puritan women?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do you know, I don’t believe in the existence of\\nPuritan women?  I don’t think there is a woman in the world who would not\\nbe a little flattered if one made love to her.  It is that which makes\\nwomen so irresistibly adorable.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You think there is no woman in the world who would object\\nto being kissed?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Very few.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you sure?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Quite.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you think she’d do if I kissed her?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her\\nglove.  What would you do if she struck you across the face with her\\nglove?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Fall in love with her, probably.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Is that a challenge?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is an arrow shot into the air.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t you know that I always succeed in whatever I\\ntry?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I am sorry to hear it.  We women adore failures.  They\\nlean on us.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You worship successes.  You cling to them.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We are the laurels to hide their baldness.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And they need you always, except at the moment of\\ntriumph.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  They are uninteresting then.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How tantalising you are!  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like\\nyou for.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only one thing?  And I have so many bad qualities.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, don’t be too conceited about them.  You may lose them\\nas you grow old.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I never intend to grow old.  The soul is born old but\\ngrows young.  That is the comedy of life.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  And the body is born young and grows old.  That is life’s\\ntragedy.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Its comedy also, sometimes.  But what is the\\nmysterious reason why you will always like me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is that you have never made love to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have never done anything else.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Really?  I have not noticed it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How fortunate!  It might have been a tragedy for both\\nof us.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We should each have survived.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One can survive everything nowadays, except death, and\\nlive down anything except a good reputation.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Have you tried a good reputation?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of the many annoyances to which I have never\\nbeen subjected.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It may come.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why do you threaten me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nFRANCIS.  Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Tell her ladyship we are coming in.\\n\\nFRANCIS.  Yes, my lord.\\n\\n[_Exit_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Shall we go in to tea?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you like such simple pleasures?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I adore simple pleasures.  They are the last refuge of\\nthe complex.  But, if you wish, let us stay here.  Yes, let us stay here.\\nThe Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It ends with Revelations.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You fence divinely.  But the button has come of your\\nfoil.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I have still the mask.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It makes your eyes lovelier.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Thank you.  Come.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT’S _letter on table_, _and takes\\nit up and looks at envelope_.]  What a curious handwriting!  It reminds\\nme of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Who?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! no one.  No one in particular.  A woman of no\\nimportance.  [_Throws letter down_, _and passes up the steps of the\\nterrace with_ MRS. ALLONBY.  _They smile at each other_.]\\n\\n                                ACT DROP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSECOND ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.\\n                               _Door_ R.C.\\n\\n[_Ladies seated on sofas_.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a\\nlittle!\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly\\nhappy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to\\nleave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing\\nspace after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be\\nabsolutely worn to shadows.\\n\\n[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up\\nto the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to\\nescape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their\\npower and use it.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense\\nall this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper\\nplace.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re\\nnot married?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a\\nwife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going\\nabout society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry\\nwithin twelve months.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they’re in love with some\\none who, perhaps, is tied to another?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off\\nin a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to\\nmeddle with other people’s property.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other\\npeople’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the\\nonly true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we\\ndon’t belong to any one.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you really think, dear Caroline, that\\nlegislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,\\nall the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like\\nmarried men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I certainly never know one from the other.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man\\nhas home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad\\nexpression in the eyes of so many married men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly\\ntedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they\\nare not.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely\\nchanged since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor dear\\nHunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I’m tired of\\nmeeting him.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you renew him from time to time, don’t you?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh no, Lady Caroline.  I have only had one husband as yet.\\nI suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  With your views on life I wonder you married at all.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  So do I.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, I believe you are really very happy in\\nyour married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from others.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, I hope not, dear.  I knew his mother quite well.\\nShe was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland’s daughters.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Victoria Stratton?  I remember her perfectly.  A silly\\nfair-haired woman with no chin.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, Ernest has a chin.  He has a very strong chin, a\\nsquare chin.  Ernest’s chin is far too square.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But do you really think a man’s chin can be too square?\\nI think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be\\nquite, quite square.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield.  It\\nis only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I adore silent men.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Ernest isn’t silent.  He talks the whole time.  But he\\nhas got no conversation.  What he talks about I don’t know.  I haven’t\\nlistened to him for years.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Have you never forgiven him then?  How sad that seems!\\nBut all life is very, very sad, is it not?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a _mauvais quart d’heure_\\nmade up of exquisite moments.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, there are moments, certainly.  But was it something\\nvery, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did?  Did he become angry with you, and\\nsay anything that was unkind or true?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh dear, no.  Ernest is invariably calm.  That is one of\\nthe reasons he always gets on my nerves.  Nothing is so aggravating as\\ncalmness.  There is something positively brutal about the good temper of\\nmost modern men.  I wonder we women stand it as well as we do.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men’s good temper shows they are not so sensitive\\nas we are, not so finely strung.  It makes a great barrier often between\\nhusband and wife, does it not?  But I would so much like to know what was\\nthe wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell\\neverybody else.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  I will make a point of repeating\\nit.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively\\non his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course\\nof his life.  I was very young at the time, so I didn’t believe him, I\\nneedn’t tell you.  Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any\\nkind till after I had been actually married four or five months.  I found\\nout then that what he had told me was perfectly true.  And that sort of\\nthing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Men always want to be a woman’s first love.  That is their\\nclumsy vanity.  We women have a more subtle instinct about things.  What\\nwe like is to be a man’s last romance.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I see what you mean.  It’s very, very beautiful.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, you don’t mean to tell me that you won’t\\nforgive your husband because he never loved any one else?  Did you ever\\nhear such a thing, Caroline?  I am quite surprised.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that\\nnothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages.  They\\napparently are getting remarkably rare.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, they’re quite out of date.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  How like the middle classes!\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes—is it not?—very, very like them.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  If what you tell us about the middle classes is true,\\nLady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit.  It is much to be\\nregretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently\\nfrivolous, under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to\\nbe.  It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we\\nall know of in society.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don’t think the frivolity of\\nthe wife has ever anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined\\nnowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else.  How\\ncan a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating\\nher as if she were a perfectly rational being?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a\\nsex that has been rational for millions and millions of years.  He can’t\\nhelp himself.  It is in his race.  The History of Woman is very\\ndifferent.  We have always been picturesque protests against the mere\\nexistence of common sense.  We saw its dangers from the first.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly most,\\nmost trying.  Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband.  I think\\nit would be so very, very helpful.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Husband?  There couldn’t be such a thing.  The\\ninstitution is wrong.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to _us_.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  He would probably be extremely realistic.\\n\\nMRS. CAROLINE.  The Ideal Man!  Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if\\nwe were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.  He should refuse\\nall our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims.  He should\\nencourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions.  He should\\nalways say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he\\nsays.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But how could he do both, dear?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should never run down other pretty women.  That would\\nshow he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much.  No; he\\nshould be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don’t attract\\nhim.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about\\nother women.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us\\nan answer all about ourselves.  He should invariably praise us for\\nwhatever qualities he knows we haven’t got.  But he should be pitiless,\\nquite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never\\ndreamed of possessing.  He should never believe that we know the use of\\nuseful things.  That would be unforgiveable.  But he should shower on us\\neverything we don’t want.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills\\nand compliments.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat\\nus with absolute respect when we are alone.  And yet he should be always\\nready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to\\nbecome miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment’s notice, and to\\noverwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be\\npositively violent at the end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever\\nat a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner.  And\\nwhen, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has\\nrefused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised\\nnever to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters,\\nhe should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long,\\nand send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine\\nquite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he\\nwas.  And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about\\neverywhere with one’s husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one\\nwas, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if\\nhis conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really\\nbadly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in\\nthe wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman’s duty to\\nforgive, and one can do it all over again from the beginning, with\\nvariations.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How clever you are, my dear!  You never mean a single\\nword you say.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  It has been quite, quite\\nentrancing.  I must try and remember it all.  There are such a number of\\ndetails that are so very, very important.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  But you have not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal\\nMan is to be.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  His reward?  Oh, infinite expectation.  That is quite\\nenough for him.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  But men are so terribly, terribly exacting, are they\\nnot?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  That makes no matter.  One should never surrender.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Not even to the Ideal Man?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Certainly not to him.  Unless, of course, one wants to\\ngrow tired of him.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Oh! . . . yes.  I see that.  It is very, very helpful.\\nDo you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?  Or are\\nthere more than one?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, my dear!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Going over to her_.]  What has happened?  Do tell me.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_in a low voice_]  I had completely forgotten that the\\nAmerican young lady has been in the room all the time.  I am afraid some\\nof this clever talk may have shocked her a little.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that will do her so much good!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Let us hope she didn’t understand much.  I think I had\\nbetter go over and talk to her.  [_Rises and goes across to_ HESTER\\nWORSLEY.]  Well, dear Miss Worsley. [_Sitting down beside her_.]  How\\nquiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time!  I suppose\\nyou have been reading a book?  There are so many books here in the\\nlibrary.\\n\\nHESTER.  No, I have been listening to the conversation.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You mustn’t believe everything that was said, you know,\\ndear.\\n\\nHESTER.  I didn’t believe any of it\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That is quite right, dear.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Continuing_.]  I couldn’t believe that any women could really\\nhold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your\\nguests.  [_An awkward pause_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hear you have such pleasant society in America.\\nQuite like our own in places, my son wrote to me.\\n\\nHESTER.  There are cliques in America as elsewhere, Lady Hunstanton.  But\\ntrue American society consists simply of all the good women and good men\\nwe have in our country.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What a sensible system, and I dare say quite pleasant\\ntoo.  I am afraid in England we have too many artificial social barriers.\\nWe don’t see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes.\\n\\nHESTER.  In America we have no lower classes.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a very strange arrangement!\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What is that dreadful girl talking about?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  She is painfully natural, is she not?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  There are a great many things you haven’t got in America,\\nI am told, Miss Worsley.  They say you have no ruins, and no curiosities.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_To_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  What nonsense!  They have their\\nmothers and their manners.\\n\\nHESTER.  The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities, Lady\\nCaroline.  They are sent over to us every summer, regularly, in the\\nsteamers, and propose to us the day after they land.  As for ruins, we\\nare trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or\\nstone.  [_Gets up to take her fan from table_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What is that, dear?  Ah, yes, an iron Exhibition, is it\\nnot, at that place that has the curious name?\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Standing by table_.]  We are trying to build up life, Lady\\nHunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests on here.\\nThis sounds strange to you all, no doubt.  How could it sound other than\\nstrange?  You rich people in England, you don’t know how you are living.\\nHow could you know?  You shut out from your society the gentle and the\\ngood.  You laugh at the simple and the pure.  Living, as you all do, on\\nothers and by them, you sneer at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread\\nto the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season.  With all your\\npomp and wealth and art you don’t know how to live—you don’t even know\\nthat.  You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the\\nbeauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of\\nlife, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing.  You have\\nlost life’s secret.  Oh, your English society seems to me shallow,\\nselfish, foolish.  It has blinded its eyes, and stopped its ears.  It\\nlies like a leper in purple.  It sits like a dead thing smeared with\\ngold.  It is all wrong, all wrong.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  I don’t think one should know of these things.  It is\\nnot very, very nice, is it?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English\\nsociety so much.  You were such a success in it.  And you were so much\\nadmired by the best people.  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said\\nof you—but it was most complimentary, and you know what an authority he\\nis on beauty.\\n\\nHESTER.  Lord Henry Weston!  I remember him, Lady Hunstanton.  A man with\\na hideous smile and a hideous past.  He is asked everywhere.  No\\ndinner-party is complete without him.  What of those whose ruin is due to\\nhim?  They are outcasts.  They are nameless.  If you met them in the\\nstreet you would turn your head away.  I don’t complain of their\\npunishment.  Let all women who have sinned be punished.\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters from terrace behind in a cloak with a lace veil\\nover her head_.  _She hears the last words and starts_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady!\\n\\nHESTER.  It is right that they should be punished, but don’t let them be\\nthe only ones to suffer.  If a man and woman have sinned, let them both\\ngo forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there.  Let them\\nboth be branded.  Set a mark, if you wish, on each, but don’t punish the\\none and let the other go free.  Don’t have one law for men and another\\nfor women.  You are unjust to women in England.  And till you count what\\nis a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man, you will always be\\nunjust, and Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of cloud,\\nwill be made dim to your eyes, or be not seen at all, or if seen, not\\nregarded.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Might I, dear Miss Worsley, as you are standing up, ask\\nyou for my cotton that is just behind you?  Thank you.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Mrs. Arbuthnot!  I am so pleased you have come\\nup.  But I didn’t hear you announced.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, I came straight in from the terrace, Lady Hunstanton,\\njust as I was.  You didn’t tell me you had a party.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Not a party.  Only a few guests who are staying in the\\nhouse, and whom you must know.  Allow me.  [_Tries to help her_.  _Rings\\nbell_.]  Caroline, this is Mrs. Arbuthnot, one of my sweetest friends.\\nLady Caroline Pontefract, Lady Stutfield, Mrs. Allonby, and my young\\nAmerican friend, Miss Worsley, who has just been telling us all how\\nwicked we are.\\n\\nHESTER.  I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly, Lady Hunstanton.\\nBut there are some things in England—\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth, I\\ndare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it,\\nwhich is much more important, Lord Illingworth would tell us.  The only\\npoint where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady Caroline’s\\nbrother, about poor Lord Henry.  He is really such good company.\\n\\n[_Enter Footman_.]\\n\\nTake Mrs. Arbuthnot’s things.\\n\\n[_Exit Footman with wraps_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  Lady Caroline, I had no idea it was your brother.  I am sorry\\nfor the pain I must have caused you—I—\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  My dear Miss Worsley, the only part of your little\\nspeech, if I may so term it, with which I thoroughly agreed, was the part\\nabout my brother.  Nothing that you could possibly say could be too bad\\nfor him.  I regard Henry as infamous, absolutely infamous.  But I am\\nbound to state, as you were remarking, Jane, that he is excellent\\ncompany, and he has one of the best cooks in London, and after a good\\ndinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relations.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON [_to_ MISS WORSLEY]  Now, do come, dear, and make friends\\nwith Mrs. Arbuthnot.  She is one of the good, sweet, simple people you\\ntold us we never admitted into society.  I am sorry to say Mrs. Arbuthnot\\ncomes very rarely to me.  But that is not my fault.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  What a bore it is the men staying so long after dinner!  I\\nexpect they are saying the most dreadful things about us.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really think so?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I was sure of it.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very horrid of them!  Shall we go onto the\\nterrace?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, anything to get away from the dowagers and the\\ndowdies.  [_Rises and goes with_ LADY STUTFIELD _to door_ L.C.]  We are\\nonly going to look at the stars, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You will find a great many, dear, a great many.  But\\ndon’t catch cold.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  We shall all miss Gerald so\\nmuch, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But has Lord Illingworth really offered to make Gerald\\nhis secretary?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, yes!  He has been most charming about it.  He has\\nthe highest possible opinion of your boy.  You don’t know Lord\\nIllingworth, I believe, dear.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have never met him.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You know him by name, no doubt?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am afraid I don’t.  I live so much out of the world,\\nand see so few people.  I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord\\nIllingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes.  That would be the last Earl but one.  He was\\na very curious man.  He wanted to marry beneath him.  Or wouldn’t, I\\nbelieve.  There was some scandal about it.  The present Lord Illingworth\\nis quite different.  He is very distinguished.  He does—well, he does\\nnothing, which I am afraid our pretty American visitor here thinks very\\nwrong of anybody, and I don’t know that he cares much for the subjects in\\nwhich you are so interested, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Do you think,\\nCaroline, that Lord Illingworth is interested in the Housing of the Poor?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I should fancy not at all, Jane.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  We all have our different tastes, have we not?  But\\nLord Illingworth has a very high position, and there is nothing he\\ncouldn’t get if he chose to ask for it.  Of course, he is comparatively a\\nyoung man still, and he has only come to his title within—how long\\nexactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworth succeeded?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  About four years, I think, Jane.  I know it was the same\\nyear in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I remember.  That would be about four years ago.\\nOf course, there were a great many people between the present Lord\\nIllingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  There was—who was there,\\nCaroline?\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  There was poor Margaret’s baby.  You remember how anxious\\nshe was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and her husband\\ndied shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of Lord\\nAscot’s sons, who, I am told, beats her.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the family.\\nAnd there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic,\\nor a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know the\\nCourt of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that he was quite\\nsane.  And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumstead’s with straws in\\nhis hair, or something very odd about him.  I can’t recall what.  I often\\nregret, Lady Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son\\nget the title.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Cecilia?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Lord Illingworth’s mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, was one\\nof the Duchess of Jerningham’s pretty daughters, and she married Sir\\nThomas Harford, who wasn’t considered a very good match for her at the\\ntime, though he was said to be the handsomest man in London.  I knew them\\nall quite intimately, and both the sons, Arthur and George.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course, Lady\\nHunstanton?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field.  Or was\\nit fishing, Caroline?  I forget.  But George came in for everything.  I\\nalways tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has\\nhad.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once.\\nMight I see him?  Can he be sent for?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, dear.  I will send one of the servants into\\nthe dining-room to fetch him.  I don’t know what keeps the gentlemen so\\nlong.  [_Rings bell_.]  When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain\\nGeorge Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young man about town, with\\nnot a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him.  She\\nwas quite devoted to him.  Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms\\nwith his father.  Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon.  [_To Servant_.]  It\\ndoesn’t matter.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ DOCTOR DAUBENY.  SIR JOHN _goes over to_ LADY\\nSTUTFIELD, DOCTOR DAUBENY _to_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining.  I have\\nnever enjoyed myself more.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_To_ DOCTOR BAUBENY.]  You see I have got Mrs.\\nArbuthnot to come to me at last.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton.  Mrs. Daubeny\\nwill be quite jealous of you.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come with you\\nto-night.  Headache as usual, I suppose.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.  But she is\\nhappiest alone.  She is happiest alone.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  [_To her husband_.]  John!  [SIR JOHN _goes over to his\\nwife_.  DOCTOR BAUBENY _talks to_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT watches LORD ILLINGWORTH the whole time.  He has passed\\nacross the room without noticing her, and approaches MRS. ALLONBY, who\\nwith LADY STUTFIELD is standing by the door looking on to the terrace.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How is the most charming woman in the world?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [Taking LADY STUTFIELD by the hand.]  We are both quite\\nwell, thank you, Lord Illingworth.  But what a short time you have been\\nin the dining-room!  It seems as if we had only just left.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was bored to death.  Never opened my lips the whole\\ntime.  Absolutely longing to come in to you.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You should have.  The American girl has been giving us a\\nlecture.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Really?  All Americans lecture, I believe.  I suppose\\nit is something in their climate.  What did she lecture about?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Puritanism, of course.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am going to convert her, am I not?  How long do you\\ngive me?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  A week.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A week is more than enough.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Going to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Dear mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, I don’t feel at all well.  See me home, Gerald.\\nI shouldn’t have come.\\n\\nGERALD.  I am so sorry, mother.  Certainly.  But you must know Lord\\nIllingworth first.  [_Goes across room_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Not to-night, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know my mother.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  With the greatest pleasure.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\nI’ll be back in a moment.  People’s mothers always bore me to death.  All\\nwomen become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  No man does.  That is his.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a delightful mood you are in to-night!  [_Turns\\nround and goes across with_ GERALD _to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  _When he sees\\nher_, _he starts back in wonder_.  _Then slowly his eyes turn towards_\\nGERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has offered to take me as\\nhis private secretary.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _bows coldly_.]  It is a\\nwonderful opening for me, isn’t it?  I hope he won’t be disappointed in\\nme, that is all.  You’ll thank Lord Illingworth, mother, won’t you?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth in very good, I am sure, to interest\\nhimself in you for the moment.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Putting his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  Oh,\\nGerald and I are great friends already, Mrs . . . Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There can be nothing in common between you and my son,\\nLord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, how can you say so?  Of course Lord Illingworth is\\nawfully clever and that sort of thing.  There is nothing Lord Illingworth\\ndoesn’t know.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy!\\n\\nGERALD.  He knows more about life than any one I have ever met.  I feel\\nan awful duffer when I am with you, Lord Illingworth.  Of course, I have\\nhad so few advantages.  I have not been to Eton or Oxford like other\\nchaps.  But Lord Illingworth doesn’t seem to mind that.  He has been\\nawfully good to me, mother.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth may change his mind.  He may not really\\nwant you as his secretary.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You must remember, as you said yourself, you have had so\\nfew advantages.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for a moment.  Do\\ncome over.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Will you excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot?  Now, don’t let\\nyour charming mother make any more difficulties, Gerald.  The thing is\\nquite settled, isn’t it?\\n\\nGERALD.  I hope so.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _goes across to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I thought you were never going to leave the lady in black\\nvelvet.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is excessively handsome.  [_Looks at_ MRS.\\nARBUTHNOT.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room?\\nMiss Worsley is going to play.  You’ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,\\nwon’t you?  You don’t know what a treat is in store for you.  [_To_\\nDOCTOR BAUBENY.]  I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to\\nthe rectory.  I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the\\nviolin.  Ah, I forgot.  Dear Mrs. Daubeny’s hearing is a little\\ndefective, is it not?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Her deafness is a great privation to her.  She can’t\\neven hear my sermons now.  She reads them at home.  But she has many\\nresources in herself, many resources.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She reads a good deal, I suppose?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  Just the very largest print.  The eyesight is rapidly\\ngoing.  But she’s never morbid, never morbid.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  Do speak to my mother, Lord\\nIllingworth, before you go into the music-room.  She seems to think,\\nsomehow, you don’t mean what you said to me.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Aren’t you coming?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  In a few moments.  Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot\\nwould allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join\\nyou later on.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, of course.  You will have a great deal to say to\\nher, and she will have a great deal to thank you for.  It is not every\\nson who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  But I know you appreciate\\nthat, dear.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  John!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, don’t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord\\nIllingworth.  We can’t spare her.\\n\\n[_Exit following the other guests_.  _Sound of violin heard from\\nmusic-room_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So that is our son, Rachel!  Well, I am very proud of\\nhim.  He in a Harford, every inch of him.  By the way, why Arbuthnot,\\nRachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  One name is as good as another, when one has no right to\\nany name.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose so—but why Gerald?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  After a man whose heart I broke—after my father.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Well, Rachel, what in over is over.  All I have got to\\nsay now in that I am very, very much pleased with our boy.  The world\\nwill know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will be\\nsomething very near, and very dear.  It is a curious thing, Rachel; my\\nlife seemed to be quite complete.  It was not so.  It lacked something,\\nit lacked a son.  I have found my son now, I am glad I have found him.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You have no right to claim him, or the smallest part of\\nhim.  The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over\\ntwenty years.  Why not let me have him for a little now?  He is quite as\\nmuch mine as yours.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Are you talking of the child you abandoned?  Of the\\nchild who, as far as you are concerned, might have died of hunger and of\\nwant?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me.  It was\\nnot I who left you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I left you because you refused to give the child a name.\\nBefore my son was born, I implored you to marry me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I had no expectations then.  And besides, Rachel, I\\nwasn’t much older than you were.  I was only twenty-two.  I was\\ntwenty-one, I believe, when the whole thing began in your father’s\\ngarden.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old\\nenough to do right also.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities are always\\ninteresting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.  As for\\nsaying I left our child to starve, that, of course, is untrue and silly.\\nMy mother offered you six hundred a year.  But you wouldn’t take\\nanything.  You simply disappeared, and carried the child away with you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I wouldn’t have accepted a penny from her.  Your father\\nwas different.  He told you, in my presence, when we were in Paris, that\\nit was your duty to marry me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, duty is what one expects from others, it is not\\nwhat one does oneself.  Of course, I was influenced by my mother.  Every\\nman is when he is young.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am glad to hear you say so.  Gerald shall certainly\\nnot go away with you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What nonsense, Rachel!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Do you think I would allow my son—\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  _Our_ son.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son [LORD ILLINGWORTH _shrugs his shoulders_]—to go\\naway with the man who spoiled my youth, who ruined my life, who has\\ntainted every moment of my days?  You don’t realise what my past has been\\nin suffering and in shame.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, I must candidly say that I think\\nGerald’s future considerably more important than your past.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald cannot separate his future from my past.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is exactly what he should do.  That is exactly\\nwhat you should help him to do.  What a typical woman you are!  You talk\\nsentimentally, and you are thoroughly selfish the whole time.  But don’t\\nlet us have a scene.  Rachel, I want you to look at this matter from the\\ncommon-sense point of view, from the point of view of what is best for\\nour son, leaving you and me out of the question.  What is our son at\\npresent?  An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank in a third-rate\\nEnglish town.  If you imagine he is quite happy in such a position, you\\nare mistaken.  He is thoroughly discontented.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He was not discontented till he met you.  You have made\\nhim so.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Of course, I made him so.  Discontent is the first\\nstep in the progress of a man or a nation.  But I did not leave him with\\na mere longing for things he could not get.  No, I made him a charming\\noffer.  He jumped at it, I need hardly say.  Any young man would.  And\\nnow, simply because it turns out that I am the boy’s own father and he my\\nown son, you propose practically to ruin his career.  That is to say, if\\nI were a perfect stranger, you would allow Gerald to go away with me, but\\nas he is my own flesh and blood you won’t.  How utterly illogical you\\nare!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not allow him to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How can you prevent it?  What excuse can you give to\\nhim for making him decline such an offer as mine?  I won’t tell him in\\nwhat relations I stand to him, I need hardly say.  But you daren’t tell\\nhim.  You know that.  Look how you have brought him up.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have brought him up to be a good man.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  And what is the result?  You have educated\\nhim to be your judge if he ever finds you out.  And a bitter, an unjust\\njudge he will be to you.  Don’t be deceived, Rachel.  Children begin by\\nloving their parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely, if ever, do\\nthey forgive them.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  George, don’t take my son away from me.  I have had\\ntwenty years of sorrow, and I have only had one thing to love me, only\\none thing to love.  You have had a life of joy, and pleasure, and\\nsuccess.  You have been quite happy, you have never thought of us.  There\\nwas no reason, according to your views of life, why you should have\\nremembered us at all.  Your meeting us was a mere accident, a horrible\\naccident.  Forget it.  Don’t come now, and rob me of . . . of all I have\\nin the whole world.  You are so rich in other things.  Leave me the\\nlittle vineyard of my life; leave me the walled-in garden and the well of\\nwater; the ewe-lamb God sent me, in pity or in wrath, oh! leave me that.\\nGeorge, don’t take Gerald from me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, at the present moment you are not necessary to\\nGerald’s career; I am.  There is nothing more to be said on the subject.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not let him go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Here is Gerald.  He has a right to decide for himself.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother, I hope you have settled it all with Lord\\nIllingworth?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have not, Gerald.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother seems not to like your coming with me, for\\nsome reason.\\n\\nGERALD.  Why, mother?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I thought you were quite happy here with me, Gerald.  I\\ndidn’t know you were so anxious to leave me.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, how can you talk like that?  Of course I have been quite\\nhappy with you.  But a man can’t stay always with his mother.  No chap\\ndoes.  I want to make myself a position, to do something.  I thought you\\nwould have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth’s secretary.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not think you would be suitable as a private\\nsecretary to Lord Illingworth.  You have no qualifications.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs.\\nArbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I surely am\\nthe best judge.  And I can only tell you that your son has all the\\nqualifications I had hoped for.  He has more, in fact, than I had even\\nthought of.  Far more.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _remains silent_.]  Have you any\\nother reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don’t wish your son to accept this\\npost?\\n\\nGERALD.  Have you, mother?  Do answer.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.  We\\nare quite by ourselves here.  Whatever it is, I need not say I will not\\nrepeat it.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you would like to be alone with your son, I will\\nleave you.  You may have some other reason you don’t wish me to hear.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have no other reason.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing as\\nsettled.  Come, you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together.\\nAnd Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I think you have acted\\nvery, very wisely.\\n\\n[_Exit with_ GERALD.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is left alone_.  _She stands\\nimmobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face_.]\\n\\n                                 ACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHIRD ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n    _The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_.  _Door at back leading on to\\n                                terrace_.\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a\\nsofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I\\nknew she would come round in the end.\\n\\nGERALD.  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know\\nshe doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is\\nperfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I\\ncouldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value\\nwhatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is\\nnot a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.\\n\\nGERALD.  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on\\nyour side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing\\nlike youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in\\nlife’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom\\nwaiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,\\nlike most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I\\nwouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of\\nthe community.\\n\\nGERALD.  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.\\nI sometimes think she must have married beneath her.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts\\nhis hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father,\\nI suppose, Gerald?\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such\\na mother as I have had.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that\\nmost mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,\\nthat a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.\\nAfter all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such\\na hole as Wrockley, could you?\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is\\noften curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in\\nit.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Slowly_.]  I suppose there is.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good\\nwomen have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their\\ninterests are so petty, aren’t they?\\n\\nGERALD.  They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care\\nmuch about.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort\\nof thing.\\n\\nGERALD.  Oh, yes, she’s always going to church.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only\\nthing worth being nowadays.  You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?\\nYou want to know life as it really is.  Not to be put of with any\\nold-fashioned theories about life.  Well, what you have to do at present\\nis simply to fit yourself for the best society.  A man who can dominate a\\nLondon dinner-table can dominate the world.  The future belongs to the\\ndandy.  It is the exquisites who are going to rule.\\n\\nGERALD.  I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always\\nbeen told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that\\nthey don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial.  By the way,\\nGerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.  Sentiment is all\\nvery well for the button-hole.  But the essential thing for a necktie is\\nstyle.  A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Laughing_.]  I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord\\nIllingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know\\nhow to talk.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to\\nevery man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you\\nwill have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.\\n\\nGERALD.  But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either\\nto feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!\\n\\nGERALD.  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of it\\nsimply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any real\\nsuccess in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule\\nsociety.  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.  You\\nmight just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at\\nonce.\\n\\nGERALD.  It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You should never try to understand them.  Women are\\npictures.  Men are problems.  If you want to know what a woman really\\nmeans—which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do—look at her,\\ndon’t listen to her.\\n\\nGERALD.  But women are awfully clever, aren’t they?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always tell them so.  But, to the\\nphilosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over\\nmind—just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.\\n\\nGERALD.  How then can women have so much power as you say they have?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The history of women is the history of the worst form\\nof tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak over the\\nstrong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.\\n\\nGERALD.  But haven’t women got a refining influence?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Nothing refines but the intellect.\\n\\nGERALD.  Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren’t there?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.\\n\\nGERALD.  But there are good women in society, aren’t there?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Far too many.\\n\\nGERALD.  But do you think women shouldn’t be good?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never tell them so, they’d all become good\\nat once.  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.  Every woman is a rebel,\\nand usually in wild revolt against herself.\\n\\nGERALD.  You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Men marry because they are tired; women because they\\nare curious.  Both are disappointed.\\n\\nGERALD.  But don’t you think one can be happy when one is married?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Perfectly happy.  But the happiness of a married man,\\nmy dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.\\n\\nGERALD.  But if one is in love?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always be in love.  That is the reason one\\nshould never marry.\\n\\nGERALD.  Love is a very wonderful thing, isn’t it?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself.\\nAnd one ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a\\nromance.  But a really _grande passion_ is comparatively rare nowadays.\\nIt is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.  That is the one\\nuse of the idle classes in a country, and the only possible explanation\\nof us Harfords.\\n\\nGERALD.  Harfords, Lord Illingworth?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is my family name.  You should study the Peerage,\\nGerald.  It is the one book a young man about town should know\\nthoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever\\ndone.  And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectly new life with me,\\nand I want you to know how to live.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _appears on terrace\\nbehind_.]  For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live\\nin it!\\n\\n[_Enter_ L.C. LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ DR. DAUBENY.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! here you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  Well, I\\nsuppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new\\nduties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good advice over a\\npleasant cigarette.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady\\nHunstanton, and the best of cigarettes.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I\\nsuppose I am too old now to learn.  Except from you, dear Archdeacon,\\nwhen you are in your nice pulpit.  But then I always know what you are\\ngoing to say, so I don’t feel alarmed.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah!\\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.  Come, dear.  [_Enter_ MRS.\\nARBUTHNOT.]  Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord\\nIllingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant\\nway in which everything has turned out for him.  Let us sit down.  [_They\\nsit down_.]  And how is your beautiful embroidery going on?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn’t she?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas.\\nBut the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal.  She has not touched\\nthe tambour frame for nine or ten years.  But she has many other\\namusements.  She is very much interested in her own health.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that is always a nice distraction, in it not?  Now,\\nwhat are you talking about, Lord Illingworth?  Do tell us.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the\\nworld has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in\\nwhich it has been able to bear them.  And that, consequently, whatever\\nthe world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now I am quite out of my depth.  I usually am when Lord\\nIllingworth says anything.  And the Humane Society is most careless.\\nThey never rescue me.  I am left to sink.  I have a dim idea, dear Lord\\nIllingworth, that you are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I\\nalways try to be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get.\\nAnd after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The only difference between the saint and the sinner\\nis that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that quite does for me.  I haven’t a word to say.\\nYou and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age.  We can’t follow Lord\\nIllingworth.  Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid.\\nTo have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays.  It shuts one\\nout from so much.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of\\nhis opinions.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You are quite right, dear.\\n\\n[GERALD _shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother_.\\n_Enter_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Jane, have you seen John anywhere?\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  You needn’t be anxious about him, dear.  He is with\\nLady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room.\\nThey seem quite happy together.  You are not going, Caroline?  Pray sit\\ndown.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  I think I had better look after John.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It doesn’t do to pay men so much attention.  And\\nCaroline has really nothing to be anxious about.  Lady Stutfield is very\\nsympathetic.  She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about\\nanother.  A beautiful nature.\\n\\n[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nAh! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs. Allonby too!  I suppose it was Mrs.\\nAllonby I saw him with.  Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere\\nfor you.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady\\nHunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! the Music-room, of course.  I thought it was the\\nYellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.  [_To the_\\nARCHDEACON.]  Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn’t she?\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  She used to be quite remarkable for her memory, but\\nsince her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early\\nchildhood.  But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great\\npleasure.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LADY STUTFIELD _and_ MR. KELVIL.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil been\\ntalking to you about?\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Bimetallism!  Is that quite a nice subject?  However, I\\nknow people discuss everything very freely nowadays.  What did Sir John\\ntalk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  About Patagonia.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a remote topic!  But very improving, I\\nhave no doubt.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia.\\nSavages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost\\nall subjects.  They are excessively advanced.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What do they do?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Apparently everything.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it\\nnot, to find that Human Nature is permanently one.—On the whole, the\\nworld is the same world, is it not?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The world is simply divided into two classes—those who\\nbelieve the incredible, like the public—and those who do the improbable—\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Like yourself?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Yes; I am always astonishing myself.  It is the only\\nthing that makes life worth living.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful\\nqualities in my own nature.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah! don’t become quite perfect all at once.  Do it\\ngradually!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t intend to grow perfect at all.  At least, I\\nhope I shan’t.  It would be most inconvenient.  Women love us for our\\ndefects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything,\\neven our gigantic intellects.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis.  We forgive\\nadoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from us.\\n\\n[_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.  _He joins_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn’t we,\\ndear Mrs. Arbuthnot?  I am sure you agree with me in that.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many\\nthings women should never forgive.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  What sort of things?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The ruin of another woman’s life.\\n\\n[_Moves slowly away to back of stage_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe\\nthere are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and\\nreformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take\\nthings very, very easily.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is\\nunbecoming.\\n\\nLADY STUTFIELD.  The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of\\nbeing terribly, terribly deceived.\\n\\nKELVIL.  The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  There is no secret of life.  Life’s aim, if it has\\none, is simply to be always looking for temptations.  There are not\\nnearly enough.  I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a\\nsingle one.  It is quite dreadful.  It makes one so nervous about the\\nfuture.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Shakes her fan at him_.]  I don’t know how it is,\\ndear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me\\nexcessively immoral.  It has been most interesting, listening to you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  All thought is immoral.  Its very essence is\\ndestruction.  If you think of anything, you kill it.  Nothing survives\\nbeing thought of.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t understand a word, Lord Illingworth.  But I\\nhave no doubt it is all quite true.  Personally, I have very little to\\nreproach myself with, on the score of thinking.  I don’t believe in women\\nthinking too much.  Women should think in moderation, as they should do\\nall things in moderation.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.  Nothing\\nsucceeds like excess.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope I shall remember that.  It sounds an admirable\\nmaxim.  But I’m beginning to forget everything.  It’s a great misfortune.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady\\nHunstanton.  No woman should have a memory.  Memory in a woman is the\\nbeginning of dowdiness.  One can always tell from a woman’s bonnet\\nwhether she has got a memory or not.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  You\\nalways find out that one’s most glaring fault is one’s most important\\nvirtue.  You have the most comforting views of life.\\n\\n[_Enter_ FARQUHAR.]\\n\\nFARQUHAR.  Doctor Daubeny’s carriage!\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Archdeacon!  It is only half-past ten.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  [_Rising_.]  I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton.\\nTuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny’s bad nights.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  Well, I won’t keep you from her.  [_Goes\\nwith him towards door_.]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of\\npartridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.\\n\\nTHE ARCHDEACON.  It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never touches\\nsolids now.  Lives entirely on jellies.  But she is wonderfully cheerful,\\nwonderfully cheerful.  She has nothing to complain of.\\n\\n[_Exit with_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Goes over to_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  There is a beautiful\\nmoon to-night.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Let us go and look at it.  To look at anything that is\\ninconstant is charming nowadays.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  You have your looking-glass.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is unkind.  It merely shows me my wrinkles.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Mine is better behaved.  It never tells me the truth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then it is in love with you.\\n\\n[_Exeunt_ SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL _and_ LORD ALFRED.]\\n\\nGERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH]  May I come too?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do, my dear boy.  [_Moves towards with_ MRS. ALLONBY\\n_and_ GERALD.]\\n\\n[LADY CAROLINE _enters_, _looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite\\ndirection to that taken by_ SIR JOHN _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  What, mother!\\n\\n[_Exit_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is getting late.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother.  Do let us wait a little longer.  Lord\\nIllingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a great\\nsurprise for you.  We are starting for India at the end of this month.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let us go home.\\n\\nGERALD.  If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid\\ngood-bye to Lord Illingworth first.  I’ll be back in five minutes.\\n[_Exit_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him—not\\nwith him!  I couldn’t bear it.  [_Walks up and down_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER.]\\n\\nHESTER.  What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Is it?\\n\\nHESTER.  Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You are so\\ndifferent from the other women here.  When you came into the Drawing-room\\nthis evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and\\npure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are things that are right to\\nsay, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.\\n\\nHESTER.  I didn’t know you had heard it.  But I knew you would agree with\\nme.  A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn’t she?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  She shouldn’t be allowed to come into the society of good men\\nand women?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  She should not.\\n\\nHESTER.  And the man should be punished in the same way?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  In the same way.  And the children, if there are\\nchildren, in the same way also?\\n\\nHESTER.  Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited\\non the children.  It is a just law.  It is God’s law.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is one of God’s terrible laws.\\n\\n[_Moves away to fireplace_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth?  Of course\\nthere is position, no doubt, and money, but position and money are not\\neverything, are they?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  They are nothing; they bring misery.\\n\\nHESTER.  Then why do you let your son go with him?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He wishes it himself.\\n\\nHESTER.  But if you asked him he would stay, would he not?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He has set his heart on going.\\n\\nHESTER.  He couldn’t refuse you anything.  He loves you too much.  Ask\\nhim to stay.  Let me send him in to you.  He is on the terrace at this\\nmoment with Lord Illingworth.  I heard them laughing together as I passed\\nthrough the Music-room.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.  It is of no\\nconsequence.\\n\\nHESTER.  No, I’ll tell him you want him.  Do—do ask him to stay.  [_Exit_\\nHESTER.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He won’t come—I know he won’t come.\\n\\n[Enter LADY CAROLINE.  _She looks round anxiously_.  _Enter_ GERALD.]\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the\\nterrace?\\n\\nGERALD.  No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace.\\n\\nLADY CAROLINE.  It is very curious.  It is time for him to retire.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting.  I forgot all about\\nit.  I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so happy.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  At the prospect of going away?\\n\\nGERALD.  Don’t put it like that, mother.  Of course I am sorry to leave\\nyou.  Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.  But after all, as\\nLord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a place as\\nWrockley.  You don’t mind it.  But I’m ambitions; I want something more\\nthan that.  I want to have a career.  I want to do something that will\\nmake you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth is going to help me.  He is\\ngoing to do everything for me.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, don’t go away with Lord Illingworth.  I implore\\nyou not to.  Gerald, I beg you!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, how changeable you are!  You don’t seem to know your own\\nmind for a single moment.  An hour and a half ago in the Drawing-room you\\nagreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and make objections, and\\ntry to force me to give up my one chance in life.  Yes, my one chance.\\nYou don’t suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every\\nday, do you, mother?  It is very strange that when I have had such a\\nwonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties in my\\nway should be my own mother.  Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester\\nWorsley.  Who could help loving her?  I love her more than I have ever\\ntold you, far more.  And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I\\ncould—I could ask her to—Don’t you understand now, mother, what it means\\nto me to be Lord Illingworth’s secretary?  To start like that is to find\\na career ready for one—before one—waiting for one.  If I were Lord\\nIllingworth’s secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.  As a wretched\\nbank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.  I know\\nher views on life.  She has just told them to me.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Then I have my ambition left, at any rate.  That is something—I\\nam glad I have that!  You have always tried to crush my ambition,\\nmother—haven’t you?  You have told me that the world is a wicked place,\\nthat success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that\\nsort of thing—well, I don’t believe it, mother.  I think the world must\\nbe delightful.  I think society must be exquisite.  I think success is a\\nthing worth having.  You have been wrong in all that you taught me,\\nmother, quite wrong.  Lord Illingworth is a successful man.  He is a\\nfashionable man.  He is a man who lives in the world and for it.  Well, I\\nwould give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I would sooner see you dead.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth?  Tell\\nme—tell me right out.  What is it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is a bad man.\\n\\nGERALD.  In what way bad?  I don’t understand what you mean.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will tell you.\\n\\nGERALD.  I suppose you think him bad, because he doesn’t believe the same\\nthings as you do.  Well, men are different from women, mother.  It is\\nnatural that they should have different views.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is not what Lord Illingworth believes, or what he\\ndoes not believe, that makes him bad.  It is what he is.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, is it something you know of him?  Something you actually\\nknow?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is something I know.\\n\\nGERALD.  Something you are quite sure of?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Quite sure of.\\n\\nGERALD.  How long have you known it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For twenty years.\\n\\nGERALD.  Is it fair to go back twenty years in any man’s career?  And\\nwhat have you or I to do with Lord Illingworth’s early life?  What\\nbusiness is it of ours?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What this man has been, he is now, and will be always.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did?  If he did anything\\nshameful, I will not go away with him.  Surely you know me well enough\\nfor that?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, come near to me.  Quite close to me, as you used\\nto do when you were a little boy, when you were mother’s own boy.\\n[GERALD _sits down betide his mother_.  _She runs her fingers through his\\nhair_, _and strokes his hands_.]  Gerald, there was a girl once, she was\\nvery young, she was little over eighteen at the time.  George\\nHarford—that was Lord Illingworth’s name then—George Harford met her.\\nShe knew nothing about life.  He—knew everything.  He made this girl love\\nhim.  He made her love him so much that she left her father’s house with\\nhim one morning.  She loved him so much, and he had promised to marry\\nher!  He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him.\\nShe was very young, and—and ignorant of what life really is.  But he put\\nthe marriage off from week to week, and month to month.—She trusted in\\nhim all the while.  She loved him.—Before her child was born—for she had\\na child—she implored him for the child’s sake to marry her, that the\\nchild might have a name, that her sin might not be visited on the child,\\nwho was innocent.  He refused.  After the child was born she left him,\\ntaking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and\\nall that was sweet, and good, and pure in her ruined also.  She suffered\\nterribly—she suffers now.  She will always suffer.  For her there is no\\njoy, no peace, no atonement.  She is a woman who drags a chain like a\\nguilty thing.  She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing that is a\\nleper.  The fire cannot purify her.  The waters cannot quench her\\nanguish.  Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her sleep! no poppies\\nforgetfulness!  She is lost!  She is a lost soul!—That is why I call Lord\\nIllingworth a bad man.  That is why I don’t want my boy to be with him.\\n\\nGERALD.  My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of course.  But I\\ndare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth\\nwas.—After all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice feelings\\nat all, go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married, and\\nlive with him as his wife?  No nice girl would.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_After a pause_.]  Gerald, I withdraw all my\\nobjections.  You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth, when\\nand where you choose.\\n\\nGERALD.  Dear mother, I knew you wouldn’t stand in my way.  You are the\\nbest woman God ever made.  And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don’t believe\\nhe is capable of anything infamous or base.  I can’t believe it of him—I\\ncan’t.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Outside_.]  Let me go!  Let me go!  [_Enter_ HESTER _in\\nterror_, _and rushes over to_ GERALD _and flings herself in his arms_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  Oh! save me—save me from him!\\n\\nGERALD.  From whom?\\n\\nHESTER.  He has insulted me!  Horribly insulted me!  Save me!\\n\\nGERALD.  Who?  Who has dared—?\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters at back of stage_.  HESTER _breaks from_\\nGERALD’S _arms and points to him_.]\\n\\nGERALD  [_He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation_.]  Lord\\nIllingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God’s earth, a thing\\nas pure as my own mother.  You have insulted the woman I love most in the\\nworld with my own mother.  As there is a God in Heaven, I will kill you!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rushing across and catching hold of him_]  No! no!\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Thrusting her back_.]  Don’t hold me, mother.  Don’t hold\\nme—I’ll kill him!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!\\n\\nGERALD.  Let me go, I say!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Stop, Gerald, stop!  He is your own father!\\n\\n[GERALD _clutches his mother’s hands and looks into her face_.  _She\\nsinks slowly on the ground in shame_.  HESTER _steals towards the door_.\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH _frowns and bites his lip_.  _After a time_ GERALD\\n_raises his mother up_, _puts his am round her_, _and leads her from the\\nroom_.]\\n\\n                                 ACT DROP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOURTH ACT\\n\\n\\n                                  SCENE\\n\\n_Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s_.  _Large open French window at back_,\\n_looking on to garden_.  _Doors_ R.C. _and_ L.C.\\n\\n[GERALD ARBUTHNOT _writing at table_.]\\n\\n[_Enter_ ALICE R.C. _followed by_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]\\n\\nALICE.  Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.\\n\\n[_Exit_ L.C.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Good morning, Gerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Rising_.]  Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs.\\nAllonby.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  We came to inquire for your dear\\nmother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?\\n\\nGERALD.  My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last\\nnight.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it\\nwas the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets\\non one’s nerves.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  It’s the same thing, nowadays.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am\\nafraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.\\nArbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]  It looks\\nquite the happy English home.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.\\nOne feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,\\nGerald.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that\\na good influence is the worst in the world.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he\\nwill change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English\\nhome.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women\\nin London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but\\norchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a\\nsweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures\\nthat one can look at without blushing.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  But I like blushing.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,\\nif one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell\\nme I didn’t blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very\\nparticular.  He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those\\nwho were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,\\nwas brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the\\ndevotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?\\nBy-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more\\noften now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you?\\n\\nGERALD.  I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s\\nsecretary.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Surely not, Gerald!  It would be most unwise of you.\\nWhat reason can you have?\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t think I should be suitable for the post.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.\\nBut he says I am not serious enough.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, you really mustn’t talk like that in this\\nhouse.  Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn’t know anything about the wicked society in\\nwhich we all live.  She won’t go into it.  She is far too good.  I\\nconsider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.  It gave\\nquite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in\\nthe air.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, how can you say that?  There is no resemblance\\nbetween the two things at all.  But really, Gerald, what do you mean by\\nnot being suitable?\\n\\nGERALD.  Lord Illingworth’s views of life and mine are too different.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn’t have any\\nviews of life.  They are quite out of place.  You must be guided by\\nothers in this matter.  Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering\\noffer, and travelling with him you would see the world—as much of it, at\\nleast, as one should look at—under the best auspices possible, and stay\\nwith all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in\\nyour career.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t want to see the world: I’ve seen enough of it.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  I hope you don’t think you have exhausted life, Mr.\\nArbuthnot.  When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t wish to leave my mother.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part.  Not\\nleave your mother!  If I were your mother I would insist on your going.\\n\\n[_Enter_ ALICE L.C.]\\n\\nALICE.  Mrs. Arbuthnot’s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad\\nheadache, and cannot see any one this morning.  [_Exit_ R.C.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps\\nyou’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better,\\nGerald.\\n\\nGERALD.  I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, to-morrow, then.  Ah, if you had a father,\\nGerald, he wouldn’t let you waste your life here.  He would send you off\\nwith Lord Illingworth at once.  But mothers are so weak.  They give up to\\ntheir sons in everything.  We are all heart, all heart.  Come, dear, I\\nmust call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid,\\nis far from well.  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite\\nwonderful.  He is the most sympathetic of husbands.  Quite a model.\\nGood-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot.\\n\\nGERALD.  Good-bye.\\n\\n[_Exit_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.  GERALD _sits down and reads\\nover his letter_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  What name can I sign?  I, who have no right to any name.\\n[_Signs name_, _puts letter into envelope_, _addresses it_, _and is about\\nto seal it_, _when door_ L.C. _opens and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters_.\\nGERALD _lays down sealing-wax_.  _Mother and son look at each other_.]\\n\\nLADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Through French window at the back_.]  Good-bye again,\\nGerald.  We are taking the short cut across your pretty garden.  Now,\\nremember my advice to you—start at once with Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nMRS. ALLONBY.  _Au revoir_, Mr. Arbuthnot.  Mind you bring me back\\nsomething nice from your travels—not an Indian shawl—on no account an\\nIndian shawl.\\n\\n[_Exeunt_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I have just written to him.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  To whom?\\n\\nGERALD.  To my father.  I have written to tell him to come here at four\\no’clock this afternoon.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He shall not come here.  He shall not cross the\\nthreshold of my house.\\n\\nGERALD.  He must come.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, if you are going away with Lord Illingworth, go\\nat once.  Go before it kills me: but don’t ask me to meet him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you don’t understand.  Nothing in the world would induce\\nme to go away with Lord Illingworth, or to leave you.  Surely you know me\\nwell enough for that.  No: I have written to him to say—\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What can you have to say to him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Can’t you guess, mother, what I have written in this letter?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, surely you can.  Think, think what must be done, now, at\\nonce, within the next few days.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is nothing to be done.\\n\\nGERALD.  I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him that he must\\nmarry you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Marry me?\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I will force him to do it.  The wrong that has been done\\nyou must be repaired.  Atonement must be made.  Justice may be slow,\\nmother, but it comes in the end.  In a few days you shall be Lord\\nIllingworth’s lawful wife.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald—\\n\\nGERALD.  I will insist upon his doing it.  I will make him do it: he will\\nnot dare to refuse.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald, it is I who refuse.  I will not marry Lord\\nIllingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  Not marry him?  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  But you don’t understand: it is for your sake I am talking, not\\nfor mine.  This marriage, this necessary marriage, this marriage which\\nfor obvious reasons must inevitably take place, will not help me, will\\nnot give me a name that will be really, rightly mine to bear.  But surely\\nit will be something for you, that you, my mother, should, however late,\\nbecome the wife of the man who is my father.  Will not that be something?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you must.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not.  You talk of atonement for a wrong done.\\nWhat atonement can be made to me?  There is no atonement possible.  I am\\ndisgraced: he is not.  That is all.  It is the usual history of a man and\\na woman as it usually happens, as it always happens.  And the ending is\\nthe ordinary ending.  The woman suffers.  The man goes free.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t know if that is the ordinary ending, mother: I hope it\\nis not.  But your life, at any rate, shall not end like that.  The man\\nshall make whatever reparation is possible.  It is not enough.  It does\\nnot wipe out the past, I know that.  But at least it makes the future\\nbetter, better for you, mother.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nGERALD.  If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would\\ngive him a different answer.  Remember, he is my father.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  If he came himself, which he will not do, my answer\\nwould be the same.  Remember I am your mother.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you make it terribly difficult for me by talking like\\nthat; and I can’t understand why you won’t look at this matter from the\\nright, from the only proper standpoint.  It is to take away the\\nbitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow that lies on your\\nname, that this marriage must take place.  There is no alternative: and\\nafter the marriage you and I can go away together.  But the marriage must\\ntake place first.  It is a duty that you owe, not merely to yourself, but\\nto all other women—yes: to all the other women in the world, lest he\\nbetray more.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I owe nothing to other women.  There is not one of them\\nto help me.  There is not one woman in the world to whom I could go for\\npity, if I would take it, or for sympathy, if I could win it.  Women are\\nhard on each other.  That girl, last night, good though she is, fled from\\nthe room as though I were a tainted thing.  She was right.  I am a\\ntainted thing.  But my wrongs are my own, and I will bear them alone.  I\\nmust bear them alone.  What have women who have not sinned to do with me,\\nor I with them?  We do not understand each other.\\n\\n[_Enter_ HESTER _behind_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  I implore you to do what I ask you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What son has ever asked of his mother to make so hideous\\na sacrifice?  None.\\n\\nGERALD.  What mother has ever refused to marry the father of her own\\nchild?  None.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let me be the first, then.  I will not do it.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you believe in religion, and you brought me up to\\nbelieve in it also.  Well, surely your religion, the religion that you\\ntaught me when I was a boy, mother, must tell you that I am right.  You\\nknow it, you feel it.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not know it.  I do not feel it, nor will I ever\\nstand before God’s altar and ask God’s blessing on so hideous a mockery\\nas a marriage between me and George Harford.  I will not say the words\\nthe Church bids us to say.  I will not say them.  I dare not.  How could\\nI swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you\\ndishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin?  No: marriage\\nis a sacrament for those who love each other.  It is not for such as him,\\nor such as me.  Gerald, to save you from the world’s sneers and taunts I\\nhave lied to the world.  For twenty years I have lied to the world.  I\\ncould not tell the world the truth.  Who can, ever?  But not for my own\\nsake will I lie to God, and in God’s presence.  No, Gerald, no ceremony,\\nChurch-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to George Harford.  It\\nmay be that I am too bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left me\\nricher, so that in the mire of my life I found the pearl of price, or\\nwhat I thought would be so.\\n\\nGERALD.  I don’t understand you now.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Men don’t understand what mothers are.  I am no\\ndifferent from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I\\ndid, and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace.  And yet, to bear\\nyou I had to look on death.  To nurture you I had to wrestle with it.\\nDeath fought with me for you.  All women have to fight with death to keep\\ntheir children.  Death, being childless, wants our children from us.\\nGerald, when you were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave\\nyou food.  Night and day all that long winter I tended you.  No office is\\ntoo mean, no care too lowly for the thing we women love—and oh! how _I_\\nloved _you_.  Not Hannah, Samuel more.  And you needed love, for you were\\nweakly, and only love could have kept you alive.  Only love can keep any\\none alive.  And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain,\\nand we always fancy that when they come to man’s estate and know us\\nbetter they will repay us.  But it is not so.  The world draws them from\\nour side, and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are\\nwith us, and have amusements from which we are barred, and interests that\\nare not ours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life\\nbitter they blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste\\nits sweetness with them . . . You made many friends and went into their\\nhouses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to\\nfollow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat\\nin darkness.  What should I have done in honest households?  My past was\\never with me. . . . And you thought I didn’t care for the pleasant things\\nof life.  I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them,\\nfeeling I had no right.  You thought I was happier working amongst the\\npoor.  That was my mission, you imagined.  It was not, but where else was\\nI to go?  The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is\\npure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the\\nkiss of sin.  It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the\\nlove you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . .\\nAnd you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in\\nChurch duties.  But where else could I turn?  God’s house is the only\\nhouse where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart,\\nGerald, too much in my heart.  For, though day after day, at morn or\\nevensong, I have knelt in God’s house, I have never repented of my sin.\\nHow could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit!  Even now\\nthat you are bitter to me I cannot repent.  I do not.  You are more to me\\nthan innocence.  I would rather be your mother—oh! much rather!—than have\\nbeen always pure . . . Oh, don’t you see? don’t you understand?  It is my\\ndishonour that has made you so dear to me.  It is my disgrace that has\\nbound you so closely to me.  It is the price I paid for you—the price of\\nsoul and body—that makes me love you as I do.  Oh, don’t ask me to do\\nthis horrible thing.  Child of my shame, be still the child of my shame!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I didn’t know you loved me so much as that.  And I will\\nbe a better son to you than I have been.  And you and I must never leave\\neach other . . . but, mother . . . I can’t help it . . . you must become\\nmy father’s wife.  You must marry him.  It is your duty.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Running forwards and embracing_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  No, no; you\\nshall not.  That would be real dishonour, the first you have ever known.\\nThat would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.  Leave him and come\\nwith me.  There are other countries than England . . . Oh! other\\ncountries over sea, better, wiser, and less unjust lands.  The world is\\nvery wide and very big.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No, not for me.  For me the world is shrivelled to a\\npalm’s breadth, and where I walk there are thorns.\\n\\nHESTER.  It shall not be so.  We shall somewhere find green valleys and\\nfresh waters, and if we weep, well, we shall weep together.  Have we not\\nboth loved him?\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester!\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Waving him back_.]  Don’t, don’t!  You cannot love me at all,\\nunless you love her also.  You cannot honour me, unless she’s holier to\\nyou.  In her all womanhood is martyred.  Not she alone, but all of us are\\nstricken in her house.\\n\\nGERALD.  Hester, Hester, what shall I do?\\n\\nHESTER.  Do you respect the man who is your father?\\n\\nGERALD.  Respect him?  I despise him!  He is infamous.\\n\\nHESTER.  I thank you for saving me from him last night.\\n\\nGERALD.  Ah, that is nothing.  I would die to save you.  But you don’t\\ntell me what to do now!\\n\\nHESTER.  Have I not thanked you for saving _me_?\\n\\nGERALD.  But what should I do?\\n\\nHESTER.  Ask your own heart, not mine.  I never had a mother to save, or\\nshame.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is hard—he is hard.  Let me go away.\\n\\nGERALD.  [_Rushes over and kneels down bedside his mother_.]  Mother,\\nforgive me: I have been to blame.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t kiss my hands: they are cold.  My heart is cold:\\nsomething has broken it.\\n\\nHESTER.  Ah, don’t say that.  Hearts live by being wounded.  Pleasure may\\nturn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but sorrow—oh, sorrow\\ncannot break it.  Besides, what sorrows have you now?  Why, at this\\nmoment you are more dear to him than ever, _dear_ though you have _been_,\\nand oh! how dear you _have_ been always.  Ah! be kind to him.\\n\\nGERALD.  You are my mother and my father all in one.  I need no second\\nparent.  It was for you I spoke, for you alone.  Oh, say something,\\nmother.  Have I but found one love to lose another?  Don’t tell me that.\\nO mother, you are cruel.  [_Gets up and flings himself sobbing on a\\nsofa_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_To_ HESTER.]  But has he found indeed another love?\\n\\nHESTER.  You know I have loved him always.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are very poor.\\n\\nHESTER.  Who, being loved, is poor?  Oh, no one.  I hate my riches.  They\\nare a burden.  Let him share it with me.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are disgraced.  We rank among the outcasts Gerald\\nis nameless.  The sins of the parents should be visited on the children.\\nIt is God’s law.\\n\\nHESTER.  I was wrong.  God’s law is only Love.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rises_, _and taking_ HESTER _by the hand_, _goes\\nslowly over to where_ GERALD _is lying on the sofa with his head buried\\nin his hands_.  _She touches him and he looks up_.]  Gerald, I cannot\\ngive you a father, but I have brought you a wife.\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  So she comes first, you are worthy.  And when you are\\naway, Gerald . . . with . . . her—oh, think of me sometimes.  Don’t\\nforget me.  And when you pray, pray for me.  We should pray when we are\\nhappiest, and you will be happy, Gerald.\\n\\nHESTER.  Oh, you don’t think of leaving us?\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother, you won’t leave us?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I might bring shame upon you!\\n\\nGERALD.  Mother!\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For a little then: and if you let me, near you always.\\n\\nHESTER.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Come out with us to the garden.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Later on, later on.  [_Exeunt_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT _goes towards door_ L.C.   _Stops at looking-glass over\\nmantelpiece and looks into it_.  _Enter_ ALICE R.C.]\\n\\nALICE.  A gentleman to see you, ma’am.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Say I am not at home.  Show me the card.  [_Takes card\\nfrom salver and looks at it_.]  Say I will not see him.\\n\\n[LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _sees him in the glass and\\nstarts_, _but does not turn round_.  _Exit_ ALICE.]  What can you have to\\nsay to me to-day, George Harford?  You can have nothing to say to me.\\nYou must leave this house.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you and me now,\\nso some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three.  I\\nassure you, he will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son may come in at any moment.  I saved you last\\nnight.  I may not be able to save you again.  My son feels my dishonour\\nstrongly, terribly strongly.  I beg you to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sitting down_.]  Last night was excessively\\nunfortunate.  That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I\\nwanted to kiss her.  What harm is there in a kiss?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  A kiss may ruin a human life, George\\nHarford.  _I_ know that.  _I_ know that too well.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  We won’t discuss that at present.  What is of\\nimportance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son.  I am extremely fond\\nof him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired his\\nconduct last night immensely.  He took up the cudgels for that pretty\\nprude with wonderful promptitude.  He is just what I should have liked a\\nson of mine to be.  Except that no son of mine should ever take the side\\nof the Puritans: that is always an error.  Now, what I propose is this.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  According to our ridiculous English laws, I can’t\\nlegitimise Gerald.  But I can leave him my property.  Illingworth is\\nentailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a place.  He can have\\nAshby, which is much prettier, Harborough, which has the best shooting in\\nthe north of England, and the house in St. James Square.  What more can a\\ngentleman require in this world?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing more, I am quite sure.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in\\nthese democratic days.  As George Harford I had everything I wanted.  Now\\nI have merely everything that other people want, which isn’t nearly so\\npleasant.  Well, my proposal is this.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I told you I was not interested, and I beg you to go.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  The boy is to be with you for six months in the year,\\nand with me for the other six.  That is perfectly fair, is it not?  You\\ncan have whatever allowance you like, and live where you choose.  As for\\nyour past, no one knows anything about it except myself and Gerald.\\nThere is the Puritan, of course, the Puritan in white muslin, but she\\ndoesn’t count.  She couldn’t tell the story without explaining that she\\nobjected to being kissed, could she?  And all the women would think her a\\nfool and the men think her a bore.  And you need not be afraid that\\nGerald won’t be my heir.  I needn’t tell you I have not the slightest\\nintention of marrying.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You come too late.  My son has no need of you.  You are\\nnot necessary.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you mean, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That you are not necessary to Gerald’s career.  He does\\nnot require you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do not understand you.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Look into the garden.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _rises and goes\\ntowards window_.]  You had better not let them see you: you bring\\nunpleasant memories.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _looks out and starts_.]  She\\nloves him.  They love each other.  We are safe from you, and we are going\\naway.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Where?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  We will not tell you, and if you find us we will not\\nknow you.  You seem surprised.  What welcome would you get from the girl\\nwhose lips you tried to soil, from the boy whose life you have shamed,\\nfrom the mother whose dishonour comes from you?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You have grown hard, Rachel.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I was too weak once.  It is well for me that I have\\nchanged.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was very young at the time.  We men know life too\\nearly.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  And we women know life too late.  That is the difference\\nbetween men and women.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, I want my son.  My money may be of no use to\\nhim now.  I may be of no use to him, but I want my son.  Bring us\\ntogether, Rachel.  You can do it if you choose.  [_Sees letter on\\ntable_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is no room in my boy’s life for you.  He is not\\ninterested in _you_.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then why does he write to me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What do you mean?\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What letter is this?  [_Takes up letter_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That—is nothing.  Give it to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is addressed to _me_.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are not to open it.  I forbid you to open it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And in Gerald’s handwriting.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not to have been sent.  It is a letter he wrote\\nto you this morning, before he saw me.  But he is sorry now he wrote it,\\nvery sorry.  You are not to open it.  Give it to me.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It belongs to me.  [_Opens it_, _sits down and reads\\nit slowly_. MRS. ARBUTHNOT _watches him all the time_.]  You have read\\nthis letter, I suppose, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  You know what is in it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t admit for a moment that the boy is right in\\nwhat he says.  I don’t admit that it is any duty of mine to marry you.  I\\ndeny it entirely.  But to get my son back I am ready—yes, I am ready to\\nmarry you, Rachel—and to treat you always with the deference and respect\\ndue to my wife.  I will marry you as soon as you choose.  I give you my\\nword of honour.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You made that promise to me once before and broke it.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I will keep it now.  And that will show you that I\\nlove my son, at least as much as you love him.  For when I marry you,\\nRachel, there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender.  High\\nambitions, too, if any ambition is high.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I decline to marry you, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you serious?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do tell me your reasons.  They would interest me\\nenormously.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have already explained them to my son.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose they were intensely sentimental, weren’t\\nthey?  You women live by your emotions and for them.  You have no\\nphilosophy of life.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are right.  We women live by our emotions and for\\nthem.  By our passions, and for them, if you will.  I have two passions,\\nLord Illingworth: my love of him, my hate of you.  You cannot kill those.\\nThey feed each other.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What sort of love is that which needs to have hate as\\nits brother?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is the sort of love I have for Gerald.  Do you think\\nthat terrible?  Well it is terrible.  All love is terrible.  All love is\\na tragedy.  I loved you once, Lord Illingworth.  Oh, what a tragedy for a\\nwoman to have loved you!\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  So you really refuse to marry me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  Because you hate me?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  And does my son hate me as you do?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am glad of that, Rachel.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He merely despises you.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a pity!  What a pity for him, I mean.\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don’t be deceived, George.  Children begin by loving\\ntheir parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely if ever do they\\nforgive them.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Reads letter over again_, _very slowly_.]  May I ask\\nby what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter, this beautiful,\\npassionate letter, believe that you should not marry his father, the\\nfather of your own child?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not I who made him see it.  It was another.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  What _fin-de-siècle_ person?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The Puritan, Lord Illingworth.  [_A pause_.]\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces_, _then rises slowly and goes over to table\\nwhere his hat and gloves are_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is standing close to the\\ntable_.  _He picks up one of the gloves, and begins pulling it on_.]\\nThere is not much then for me to do here, Rachel?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is good-bye, is it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For ever, I hope, this time, Lord Illingworth.\\n\\nLORD ILLINGWORTH.  How curious!  At this moment you look exactly as you\\nlooked the night you left me twenty years ago.  You have just the same\\nexpression in your mouth.  Upon my word, Rachel, no woman ever loved me\\nas you did.  Why, you gave yourself to me like a flower, to do anything I\\nliked with.  You were the prettiest of playthings, the most fascinating\\nof small romances . . . [_Pulls out watch_.]  Quarter to two!  Must be\\nstrolling back to Hunstanton.  Don’t suppose I shall see you there again.\\nI’m sorry, I am, really.  It’s been an amusing experience to have met\\namongst people of one’s own rank, and treated quite seriously too, one’s\\nmistress, and one’s—\\n\\n[MRS. ARBUTHNOT _snatches up glove and strikes_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _across\\nthe face with it_.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _starts_.  _He is dazed by the\\ninsult of his punishment_.  _Then he controls himself_, _and goes to\\nwindow and looks out at his son_.  _Sighs and leaves the room_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Falls sobbing on the sofa_.]  He would have said it.\\nHe would have said it.\\n\\n[_Enter_ GERALD _and_ HESTER _from the garden_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Well, dear mother.  You never came out after all.  So we have\\ncome in to fetch you.  Mother, you have not been crying?  [_Kneels down\\nbeside her_.]\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My boy!  My boy!  My boy!  [_Running her fingers through\\nhis hair_.]\\n\\nHESTER.  [_Coming over_.]  But you have two children now.  You’ll let me\\nbe your daughter?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Looking up_.]  Would you choose me for a mother?\\n\\nHESTER.  You of all women I have ever known.\\n\\n[_They move towards the door leading into garden with their arms round\\neach other’s waists_.  GERALD _goes to table_ L.C. _for his hat_.  _On\\nturning round he sees_ LORD ILLINGWORTH’S _glove lying on the floor_,\\n_and picks it up_.]\\n\\nGERALD.  Hallo, mother, whose glove is this?  You have had a visitor.\\nWho was it?\\n\\nMRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  Oh! no one.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"
